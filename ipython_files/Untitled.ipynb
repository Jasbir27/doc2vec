The pinch was felt on the Holi day when many localities went without adequate water supply. Besides Old City, the complaints of water shortage poured in from posh localities of Indiranagar, Mahanagar, Niralanagar and Gomtinagar.The common complaint was that the pressure of water supply was low. As a result, people could get water only through jet pumps and that too for a limited period. Jal Sansthan officials denied reports of water crisis and for \\'low pressure\\' blamed damage in pipelines caused due to digging of roads for laying of sewer lines. Experts in groundwater department said that the problem was mainly in areas where the groundwater levels have gone down drastically.Secretary, Jal Sansthan, Raghuvendra Kumar said that there is water crisis in the city as of now. However, a study of groundwater department shows a different picture. Lucknow\\'s population is nearly 30 lakh. The Jal Sansthan claims that city\\'s water demand is 480 million litre daily (MLD), whereas sources said that the demand is over 550 MLD. While nearly 30% of the supply is through surface water sources, remaining 70% demand is met by ground water.The state capital is losing 6 lakh litres of groundwater reserves daily because of indiscriminate extraction.\"As a result, Lucknow\\'s ground water level is going down at the rate of 73 cm per year. The water discharge from the tube-wells is decreasing. A study of the Central Ground Water Board has projected large scale land subsidence in the city due to extensive withdrawal of groundwater for the past two decades. But, the situation can be improved by rainwater harvesting at a big place by public and government,\" said R S Sinha, hydrogeologist at state ground water department.The city\\'s rooftop area is around 50 sq km. The average rainfall in the city in the four monsoon months is around 902 mm. The rain water harvesting, on an average, can collect over 20 million cubic metres of rain water per year from rooftops and use it for re-charging the ground water.The tube-wells within the city should be phased out systematically. In their place, water supply should be done by setting up tube-wells on the outskirts, where aquifers are rich, he said.B B Trivedi, senior scientist (retired), Union Ministry of Water Resources, said, \"We also need to restore old water bodies along with strict ordinance to earmark at least 20% of total area in all upcoming habitations for surface water bodies. In 1950, Lucknow had 368 hectares of water bodies which is now reduced by more than 150 hectare. The Ground Water Conservation Act should also stipulate strict norms for Jal Sansthan and Jal Nigam besides individuals and industries.\"',\n",

India, according to him, is not an emerging market as it is a sizable country with numerous investment opportunities. Currently, around 85-90% of Berkshire Hathaway\\'s investments are in US companies.True to Buffett\\'s style of keeping things simple he will not invest in sectors that are rapidly changing. These sectors, according to him, will see only a few winners emerging and are thus difficult to place bets on.\"I will not invest in those companies whose future I cannot predict with any degree of certainty.\" He added: \"There are so many areas in India that are out of my area of competence. But similar to how I make investments in the US, I will look at companies where there is a modest rate of change.\" This means that sectors such as technology and semiconductor, which he admits to have little competence in, might not be top priority.As far as Berkshire Hathway\\'s insurance foray into India is concerned, he said that for the time-being it will remain a corporate agency.A hike in the 26% limit in insurance FDI would help, he said. On outsourcing concerns in the US, he said that out of 309 million people (US citizens), some are bound to be upset. \"I believe in free trade and it is good to see that US exports have risen to 12% of GDP as compared to 5% around 40 years ago. The more prosperous the rest of the world is, the better it is for the US,\" he said.Berkshire Hathaway also has a stake in Korean steel giant Posco which is facing hurdles in expanding its projects in India. On being asked whether he would raise this issue with the Indian Prime Minister, Buffett said, \"I will discuss with the Prime Minister what he wants to discuss, and not what I want.\"On PhilanthropyThough Warren Buffett has multiple agendas during his trip to India, philanthropy will be one of the key areas of discourse. However Buffett has made it clear that his motive is not to preach to the business community what are the best philanthropic practices. \"Bill Gates and I will meet some wealthy people shortly. We will just discuss with them what we have done in the US and how we have pledged money for philanthropy,\" he added. Buffett said that discussion is key as ideas can be exchanged and there is no sense in telling people how to go about making philanthropic decisions.Buffett said that he always tells his children, who are into philanthropy, that if everything is going smooth then they are probably working on the wrong issues. \"Working on social causesbe it epidemics, diseases, etc, are very challenging and there will be several hurdles on the way,\" he said. Buffett added that his late wife Susie Buffett wanted him to get into philanthropy much earlier in life. He added that the deal was that he would earn the money and she would be involved in philanthropic activities as she was every dedicated to social causes.On being asked how he had the heart to give away 99% of his wealth to charity, he said that he has a very good life where all is his are adequately met. \"I am giving up something that has no value to me but has value to others.\"On Ajit Jain:\"Ajit walked into our office on a Saturday in 1985 and I knew I was talking to somebody with incredible power. He loves what he does. He\\'s not working to take my job. He\\'s extraordinary. He\\'s almost like a brother or son. He has excelled in every single task he has done and behaves in a way that\\'s really honourable and more than generous. He could have made a lot more money working for somebody else than working for Berkshire. He\\'s unbelievably loyal and hardworking. If you have one more like him, send him over.\"On donating 99% wealth to charity\"I have never given up a meal, never given up going to a movie, never given up taking my family on vacation. I have everything in the world that I possibly want. That money will do nothing for me, but a lot for other people. There\\'s nothing in my life I would change, except my age.Can charity can make up for a corporate governance flaw?\"I don\\'t really think that way. Charity stands on its own. Big time charity should tackle things that will fail. When you succeed in everything that you do in charity, you are attempting things a little too easy. If corporate governance is flawed, it has to be changed. That\\'s a separate issue.',\n",

But the way crucial defence projects are run in the country needs a complete overhaul, with concrete long-term planning to systematically build military capabilities indigenously.Tabled in Parliament on Tuesday, the latest CAG report is a stinging indictment of the way the defence ministry, Navy and defence shipyards plan and execute construction of destroyers, frigates and corvettes.The audit watchdog has slammed the 240% jump in \"approved costs\" of Project-17 to build three 4,900-tonne Shivalik-class stealth frigates and Project-15A to construct three 6,500-tonne Kolkata-class destroyers, both of which are also running five years behind schedule at Mazagon Docks (MDL) after they were first approved in 1998 and 2001 respectively.\"The total cost of the two projects has gone up from Rs 5,830 crore to Rs 19,763 crore already from the original sanction. The actual costs will be even higher since the projects are still in progress,\" said deputy CAG Rekha Gupta. Incidentally, over the last couple of years, TOI has reported the huge delays and cost overruns in these two projects.That\\'s not all. Project-28 to construct four 2,400-tonne anti-submarine warfare corvettes at the Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers Ltd (GRSE) at Kolkata is facing similar problems. \"Till date, only one frigate (INS Shivalik) has been commissioned as against the expected nine warships by August 2010...The costs projected to the Cabinet Committee on Security were simplistic, ad-hoc and based upon incorrectly estimated build periods,\" said CAG.All this was primarily due to delays in finalization of structural drawings and timely availability of steel as well as the grossly inadequate infrastructure of the defence PSUs or shipyards. CAG also pulled up MDL for including \"inadmissible items\" like mobile phones, cordless phones, DVD players and air and train fare towards construction costs.It was way back in 1964 that the government authorized a force-level of at least 138 warships for Navy.',\n",

The Union health ministry officials told Bill and Melinda Gates on Tuesday that the long awaited pentavalent vaccine would be rolled out as a pilot project in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Both these states have high routine immunization coverage rate.Bill Gates is, however, keen for the introduction of the pentavalent vaccine across five states. He offered $110 million to fund the project. However, the ministry officials explained it to him that the roll-out has to be staggered due to the coming assembly polls.Officials told TOI that \"introducing the pentavalent vaccine is under our active consideration.

So, RBI will now be empowered to call for records of insurance companies and private equity arms, among others.The biggest change, however, is the government\\'s efforts to revive the long-pending proposal to remove the 10% cap on voting rights in private sector banks. Once the bill is approved by Parliament, shareholders will be able to vote in line with the stake held by them. In fact, there was a surprise in the bill with the government proposing to increase the voting right cap in public sector banks from 1% to 10%. The move, market players said, could increase the valuations of state-owned lenders, whose shares are undervalued compared to their private sector rivals.The government has also sought Parliamentary nod to give them powers to raise capital through bonus shares and rights issues. The move will help the banks access capital to fund expansion plans. All banks are proposed to be allowed to raise capital by way of preference shares.This relaxation for private banks came with the rider that RBI will approve all cases where shareholding by an investor or those acting in concert exceeded 5%. The regulator is expected to be armed with powers to ensure that control of a bank is in the hands of \"fit and proper persons\". Further, RBI would soon get powers to supersede the board of a bank, a step up from the present provision that allows it to remove directors and executives. The proposals come ahead of issuing fresh banking licences.',\n",

The monopoly status of VSNL was withdrawn. The cash reserves of the company was drawn down and a special dividend of 750% was declared. We then put in stringent conditions for the surplus land,\" Shourie told TOI reacting to the communication\\'s ministry\\'s move to question the disinvestment of VSNL.\"The government has lost its head to a bully,\" Shourie said on the communications ministry\\'s probe and said issues were being distorted. He said a controversy was being sought to be created on a non-issue.Shourie said clauses were built into the shareholders agreement and share purchase agreement that the winning bidder would have no share in the new entity that was to be created for the surplus land.According to the shareholders agreement between Panatone Finvest and the government, the surplus land was to be demerged into a separate entity. Clause 4.7 of the agreement made it clear that the winning bidder would have no share in the new entity.Shourie said that clauses were added to the agreement to ensure that even if the demerger did not take place and government permitted sale of any portion of the land, the strategic partner would not get a share from the proceeds of sale on the 25% equity holding it acquired in VSNL. It would have to pass the proceeds on to the government. The law ministry had scrutinized and approved the agreements.\"The government continues to have a complete veto on the land and land use. It still holds 26% in the company,\" Shourie said.According to clause 4.7 of the agreement, the strategic partner will transfer all such shares in the resulting company to the government as it may acquire as a consequence of this transaction, that is a minimum of 25% of the resulting company\\'s issued equity shares or a higher number which shall include shares in the resulting company that it may further acquire as a consequence of any further sale of the equity shares in the company by the government to the strategic partner.',\n",

This includes five fully-operational airbases, an extensive rail network and over 58,000-km of roads in TAR, which makes it possible for China to swiftly move over 30 divisions (each with over 15,000 soldiers) to the LAC, outnumbering Indian forces by at least 3:1, as reported by TOI earlier.The 15 roads constructed by India measure around 600-km out of the total of 3,808 km required for the 73 all-weather roads. The 73 roads cover all the three sectors of LAC western (Ladakh), middle (Uttarakhand, Himachal) and eastern (Sikkim, Arunachal) and include more east-west lateral links as well as better access routes to strategic peaks and valleys.The Army, alarmed at the excruciatingly slow progress in construction of the border roads, has been demanding that infrastructure build-up within 50 km of LAC as well as LoC with Pakistan should be exempted from requisite long-winded environmental and other clearances. India is taking other steps to shore up its defences against China. The measures range from planning a new mountain strike corps (over 45,000 troops) after raising two new mountain infantry divisions, with 1,260 officers and 35,011 soldiers in Nagaland and Assam, to the progressive deployment of Sukhoi-30MKI fighters, spy drones, helicopters and missile squadrons in the north-east.',\n",

However, it also clarified that both school and board-based exams are equivalent and should be treated at par by other boards. It also said that in the long term it plans to do away with board-based exam.With these contrasting statements, CBSE thus maintained its ambiguity that has caused the bitter dispute with Maharashtra state board. The Maharashtra board has barred entry of students opting for school-based exam into state-run junior colleges. The CBSE ambiguity invited the wrath of parents from all over the state and many of them approached the judiciary at Bombay and Nagpur to get justice.The Delhi-based board's assertion came through an affidavit filed in the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court by its assistant secretary (legal) S Dharini Arun. A division bench comprising justices Bhushan Dharmadhikari and Pramod Kode then adjourned the plea till Monday after the petitioner's counsel Nitin Lalwani sought time to reply.The CBSE's reply came while hearing a plea by Aggrieved Parents' Forum (APF), which had challenged state's decision to prohibit CBSE school-assessment students from getting admission. The petitioners have made state education department, deputy director of education in Nagpur, and Centre Point School as respondents, besides the state and CBSE.The CBSE further informed that it had introduced school-assessment pattern with internal evaluation last year to de-stress students. Accordingly, it introduced Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE) in its affiliated schools from October 2009 while it decided to progressively implement the scheme all over the country.Even while evaluation was to be done internally by school teachers, control over the entire process of school-based exam has been retained by CBSE. The board sets the question papers, provides marking scheme for evaluation, appoints moderators for checking papers and also introduced a mentoring system in schools.The CBSE categorically stated that internal evaluation did not undermine the legitimacy, standardization and authenticity of school-based examination. Moreover, the results of both exams were declared simultaneously and even the marklists are the same.Taking a dig at the state, CBSE strongly argued that no other board in the country has denied admission to students who opted for school-based exam. It further contended that CBSE Class X exam is valid, legal and duly recognized by the Maharashtra government.The affidavit further said that CBSE chairman Vineet Joshi had met state principal secretary and chief protocol officer of General Administration Department (GAD) on July 5, where it was agreed that CBSE school-based exam students would be allowed to apply for Class XI admission in state junior colleges.\",\n",

Of these, 25 have not been working since many years. On any given day, at least 20 do not work, as per the complaints registered by the traffic police.Actually, pedestrian signals have not been functioning at almost every signal, said an official from NMC\\'s traffic department. This March, the NMC had entrusted Decofirn Construction with maintaining city\\'s traffic signals. The NMC had allotted the annual maintenance contract for Rs 16 lakh.However, the firm appears not to be up to the task at hand. Traffic police have already expressed concern over poor functioning of city traffic signals. A head constable responsible for checking on traffic signals pointed out that the situation had in fact worsened over last couple of years. He said the signals were well maintained when Keltron, a Kerala government undertaking was looking after maintenance work.He also pointed out that the then DCP (traffic) Sahebrao Patil had suggested the NMC to appoint two different agencies to maintain the signals. However, the NMC ignored the suggestion. \"Had the suggestion been implemented, the situation might have been better,\" said the head constable.Sources alleged that the agency\\'s lethargic attitude was responsible for poor functioning of signals. It has appointed only two persons to maintain signals throughout the city. As a result, most signals in outer parts of the city are not functioning.Traffic constables deployed at such junctions wondered why the civic body was not taking the firm to task. \"The corporation should ask the firm details about the number of personnel and machinery it has deployed.

The next exercise that the working group undertook was to estimate the number of doctors needed to achieve this target. The working group looked at the existing number of medical colleges, the current intake of these colleges and the critical mass of doctors that would be needed to achieve this target.Currently, there are 330 medical colleges with an intake of approximately 35,000 students. With this intake, the shortfall of doctors by 2031 is estimated to be 9.54 lakh.The note said that in view of the projected increase in population, the existing medical colleges would be unable to meet this need and the current intake of medical colleges and the critical mass of doctors needed to be at least doubled to achieve the target.The working group also looked at the problem of teacher shortage in medical colleges. India at present needs 29,400 teachers but there is a shortfall of 6,340 teachers. There will be an additional need for 35,740 teachers in India soon, the report said.According to the detailed break-up, subjects like anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, pharmacology, pathology, surgery, medicine and forensic medicine each need 2,000 faculty members. But almost all these departments have a current shortfall of 500-1,500 teachers. Additionally, all these departments would each need 2,100-3,500 teachers in the near future.Community medicine at present needs 2,400 teachers and has a shortfall of 500 teachers and would additionally need 2,900 teachers.Gyneacology currently requires 1,600 teachers and would need an additional 1,760 faculty members.Under short-term solutions, the committee recommended increasing the intake in existing medical colleges wherever adequate infrastructure of teachers and equipment was available. It also suggested attaching established medical colleges to district level hospitals or secondary hospitals run by government agencies.In medium-term solutions, achievable in three years, it was recommended to upgrade larger district hospitals and augment their infrastructure to become community medical colleges through public private partnership.Under long-term solutions, achievable in five years, starting new medical colleges and hospitals was recommended, preferably in states and areas underserved by doctors and medical colleges.According to a Planning Commission report, India is short of six lakh doctors, 10 lakh nurses and two lakh dental surgeons. Ironically, Indian doctors who have migrated to developed countries form nearly 5% of their medical workforce. Almost 60,000 Indian physicians are estimated to be working in countries like US, UK, Canada and Australia alone.The note was prepared by a committee including Prof George Mathew, principal, Christian Medical College; Prof Nilima Kshirsagar, former vice-chancellor of Maharashtra University of Health Sciences; Prof J M Kaul, professor of anatomy, Maulana Azad Medical College; Prof Sandeep Guleria, professor, department of surgery, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, and Brig Chander Mohan, former head of radio diagnosis at Army Hospital (Research and Referral).\",\n",

They consider it as a holy mission which bring them closer to the Lord. More than 90 artisans are making the statues for Ganesh Charturthi. They are happy with the response they are getting in the city.These artisans are here to showcase their skills.Ganesh idols are worshipped individually and in a collective manner on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi. An sculptor from West Bengal informed that this is not the only occasion for them to earn as they were busy in making the idols of Goddess Durga and other lords throughout the year.\"We are always working. We make Durga idols during Navratri. Idols of Lord Shiva for Shivratri and idols of Lord Ganesha for Ganesh Chaturthi,\" said Sanjay Goswami.The artisans informed that this year more than 60 sculptors are in the city to prepare the statues of Lord Ganesha. The cost of these statues range from Rs 500 for the small ones to Rs 11,000 for the big ones. They also make statues on demand.Elaborating the sequence and process of making these pious statues, an artisan said that mainly the sculptures are made of mud and clay. But as per the new trend, the Ganesh idols are mostly made of plaster of Paris or China clay.\"We prepare Ganesh idol from China clay or mud. The demand these day is for idols made from plaster of Paris. These are lighter and more attractive. There is a difference between idols made from mud and plaster of Paris, said Niranjan Thakur, a statue-maker.There are references in the Puranas that Ganapati was created from grime. Hence, the artisans find it appropriate to use a Ganesh idol made of mud for ritualistic worship.It is worth mentioning here that as per the Hindu mythology, the spiritual Idols should be a seated one, not standing. A senior artisan informed about the reason why the Idols were made only in sitting position.If a guest pays a visit to our home, we offer him a seat and not keep him standing. During Ganesh Chaturthi, we invoke Lord Ganapati, that is invite Him. One should offer Him a seat and proper hospitality.Hence for this spiritual emotion, all the statues of Ganesha are made in sitting position, said Baba, an old artisan from Assam.He informed that scientifically the reason for sitting statues is due to the entire weight of the idol resting on the feet. The idol may break if it is kept in the standing position for ten consecutive days. Making idols is a holy mission for the artisans. \"Every idol-maker should be pure and spiritually inclined. He must keep one thing in mind that it is not he who is making the idol, rather it is the Lord, who is getting it done through him,\" said a senior artisan.\"An sculptor should have a faith that making idols is not a vocation but a holy mission. When an idol is made with faith, amidst chanting of the Lord\\'s name and observance of all the restrictions, it becomesmore pious,\" said Himani, a young artisan.',\n",

In six months, travellers can expect to use not just clean, but also disinfected linen and towels as CR will be commissioning a 12-tonne capacity, fully automated in-house laundry at Wadi Bunder.As a pilot project, CR had commissioned a 2-tonne-per-day capacity in-house laundry in November 2009. Buoyed by the results, the authorities decided to install a larger laundry that can wash 12,000 bedrolls a day, the total demand of CR in Mumbai. CR operates around 100 AC coaches from Mumbai daily.The new Rs 15-crore facility, called the Tunnel Laundry System, does the washing, extraction drying and ironing at an economical cost and with reduced resources. Expected to be commissioned in six months, the plant will be set up on a Build, Operate, Own and Transfer basis for 15 years. Spanish firm Girbau has been selected to set up a laundry on 1,150 square metres at Wadi Bunder near Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus.A senior CR official said, \"Once the machine, the first of its kind in India, is commissioned, we will not have to depend on private contractors. It will ensure assured delivery on time, which is critical for the railways as bedrolls have to reach well before the departure of a train. As the washing will be done in-house, CR will also be able to keep tabs on quality. We are confident of providing disinfected linen.\"The integrated Tunnel Batch System scores over any conventional laundry system at every stage. It is an integrated system requiring lesser initial investment, lesser running cost, lesser maintenance and far lesser manpower. The machine will be handed over free of cost to the railways after 15 years. Till then, the company will maintain the laundry and train employees.As of now, the railways pay Rs 4.40 per bed sheet to private laundry operators. This does not include the cost of loading and unloading. The cost incurred on washing will fall to about Rs 3.80 per bed sheet for the in-house operator.The official said, \"The cost to be incurred by the railways for washing linen in the in-house fully automated laundry will be Rs 79.9 crore over 15 years. The current arrangement with private contractors means the railways would pay Rs 91.98 crore in the same time, and that does not include dry-cleaning for blankets.\"The environmentally friendly integrated laundry uses one-third the water, half the power and half the chemicals of other laundry systems. Meanwhile, it generates less waste water with substantially less toxic compounds to be discharged into the ground.The machine is environmentally friendly as there will be savings in water and power consumption.

The plastic manufacturing units have for years been encouraged by the government and have even enjoyed \\'industry\\' status including reliefs like free power and tax exemptions.About 25 kms from the core city, is Hyderabad\\'s plastic hub of Kattedan which adds Rs 150 crore annual revenue to the state coffers. It earned the \\'green industry\\' tag for being a non-polluting industry, but these are facts possibly buried in government files and conveniently forgotten for now as the government gears up to clamp down on these units.Even today, this part of town enjoys all the benefits guaranteed to industrial units across Andhra Pradesh. And the growth in these units is for everyone to see-- the tall compound walls and shabby exteriors of these 600-odd plastic manufacturing units dotting the bylanes of Kattedan open in to swank offices and multi-layered plastic processing factories. With a 5-lakh strong workforce, annual turnovers of some units as high as Rs 100 crore and elaborate workshops, these plastic companies do not remotely resemble the seedy kind of units one would associate with cheap plastic bags.

Dr R K Pachauri, director general, TERI, said: \"With the high rates of economic growth that India is registering and is likely to achieve in the future, a major expansion in infrastructure is bound to take place in the coming years. To ensure efficient use of resources, including energy, lower levels of environmental impacts and meeting the challenge of climate change, it is essential that we carry out greening of India\\'s infrastructure.\"VP Baligar, chairman and managing director, HUDCO, added: \"Under the purview of this MoU, TERI and HUDCO have agreed to promote Government of India\\'s directive that all buildings constructed by the central government/PSUs should at least aim to achieve three-star rating of green building, which means energy conservation shall be central in planning, design and construction.\"',\n",

The alumni are ready to support and help their old institution in every way possible. Activist Gerson Da Cunha, Chief Justice of India Sarosh Homi Kapadia, Padma Bhushan recipient Jal Mehta, a leprosy surgeon, were among the former students of the SSC section of the Mazgaon school.For cosmetic surgeon Anil Tibrewala it was hard to believe that the honest teachers and principals could be charged of misuse of funds. \"I was shocked to read about the criteria on which the education department has derecognized the school. The school did not have a toilet even then, but the playground had a toilet and it was just 20 feet away from the building. In an emergency, a student was allowed to use the staff\\'s toilet.Though the allegation of capitation fees needs to be probed, the other grounds look quite frivolous.\" He added that it looked like a disgruntled parent trying to hold the school to ransom. \"I support the school\\'s stand,\" he said.Anil Verma, who is now the executive director on the board of Godrej and Boyce, still carries \"cherished memories of the institution\". \"My younger brother who was also in the same school is now a research scientist in the US.

Many national and international retail brands are itching to make an entry into the city as some big ticket properties are set to be opened this year.Phoenix Market City Pune, promoted by the owners of Mumbai\\'s Phoenix Mills, is burning the midnight oil to open its 3 million sq ft mall in Pune in the next two months. As much as 89 per cent of the leased part of this mixed-use mall has already been booked and 79 per cent of the outright sale part has been signed.Vamona Developers Private Limited, the special purpose vehicle company formed to promote and manage the mall, has invested Rs 700 crore in the property, says Tushar Mehta, centre director for Pune.Leading the pack of retailers which will occupy the mall are Reliance Trends, Star Bazaar - set up by the Tatas and US-based retail chain Tesco - and Andhra\\'s entertainment player PVR Group, which is setting up a nine-screen multiplex.Then there\\'s the K Raheja Group-controlled InOrbit mall, which has a retail built-up area of around 5.27 lakh sq ft, fully air-conditioned and dedicated to shopping, specialty restaurants, leisure and entertainment. Among the major occupants of InOrbit is the Spar food specialty store, promoted by Dubai-based Landmark Group, which is already present in the city with a Lifestyle store.It\\'s not the malls alone that are driving the action on the retail scene. Standalone brand stores, too, are targeting customers in the city. Consumer products major Godrej Group last week opened a 2,000 sq ft retail store - Godrej Nature\\'s Basket, which promises to offer the best in gourmet and fine food, beverages and ingredients from around the world.\"Pune is a multicultural destination with residents from across the world and local residents who are well-travelled, knowledgeable and have evolved palates,\" Omit Chatter, managing director of Godrej Nature\\'s Basket, told TOI. This is the 13th store in the Godrej Nature\\'s Basket chain and the company is already contemplating another in the city.Mohammed Salam, head of Pune operations for real estate consultancy Jones Lang LaSalle India, said Pune\\'s retail scenario has picked up far ahead of other mid-sized cities in Maharashtra.\"On the heels of increased job security and salary hikes in the corporate sector, retailers perceive that spending power and willingness to spend among Pune\\'s population has increased. As a result, a number of new malls are being launched or are in the pipeline, and a number of new domestic and international retail brands have forayed into the city,\" he said.Thanks to Pune\\'s steady growth trajectory in terms of qualified manpower responding to the increasing employment opportunities in the IT / ITeS and manufacturing sectors, retail will hold its own and the space-versus-demand equation will eventually even itself out, Salam added.According to him, there has been a marked increase in retail space requirements in recent times, but the likelihood of space absorption challenges over the next 18 months are not ruled out. Certain shopping centres in less than ideal locations may have to consider a mixed-use rather than pure retail formula in order to break even, he observed.A recent report by real estate advisory Cushman & Wakefield says in spite of high availability (of retail space) across many markets, mall rentals largely remained stable owing to a spike in enquiries.\"Positive economic outlook and anticipated increase in demand from several multinational and large Indian brands will stimulate Pune\\'s retail market, particularly main streets, over the next 3 to 6 months,\" the report says.',\n",

Another reason is that the state is home to 19% of all mines in India, employing over 5 lakh migrant workers. Also, everyday 25,000 truckers travel through Rajasthan. The prevalence of HIV is very high among the truckers.Health minister A A Khan said, \"Our efforts are to bring the numbers to zero by 2015 and we are working on to achieve the target.\"In Jaipur and Udaipur, NRHM would assist the RSACS to spread the awareness by launching a campaign with Red Ribbon buses from December 15.Joint director of information education and communication Pradeep Choudhary said, \"We will hold camps in the interior areas of the districts where primary health centres are quite far away.\"Ajmer chief medical and health officer Dr Laxman Harchandani said, \"In Ajmer there are 1,650 people living with HIV.

       " '58dbde3ba3d24b6ac1ef83f8': 'NEW DELHI: How many people die of malaria in the country every year? The government is not sure and has, therefore, formed a 16-member expert group under the chairmanship of Dr Padam Singh, former additional director-general of Indian Council of Medical Research, to pinpoint the country\\'s exact malaria deaths.According to figures from the country\\'s National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), India records around 1,000 deaths every year due to malaria. The World Health Organisation, on the other hand, says that 15,000 people die of malaria annually in India.Now, a recent paper published in the British medical journal \\'Lancet\\' said that malaria kills 13 times more Indians every year than estimated so far by WHO. This means that two lakh people under the age of 70 die of malaria every year. Of these, 90% of the deaths are in rural areas and 86% do not occur in any healthcare facility, according to the \\'Lancet\\' study.Confirming this to TOI, a ministry official said, \"At present the malaria mortality figures quoted by NVBDCP are those cases which are microscopically confirmed. WHO uses its own methodology while \\'Lancet\\' used another model.\" The official said, \"The expert committee, which has members from the ministry, WHO, ICMR and National Institute of Medical Statistics is currently working on developing a mathematical formula to assess the country\\'s actual malaria death burden.\"The minutes of the last meeting of the expert group held on December 7, available with TOI, said, \"The meeting was convened to come out with our own national estimates of malaria attributable deaths that will bridge the gap between the figures of the programme and the \\'Lancet\\' paper.\"Dr Singh has, meanwhile, asked NVBDCP to come out with comments on why the \\'Lancet\\' paper\\'s findings should not be accepted. Experts then said that the WHO model giving upper and lower estimates had fallacies and WHO be asked to give a pointed number. Dr R C Mahajan, committee member and former head of the department of parasitology of Chandigarh\\'s PGIMER, said, \"India is a diverse country and hence areas cannot be taken generally or extrapolated.\"Experts felt the need to clearly define \"clinical malaria, probable malaria and confirmed malaria cases\" so as to avoid any bias in recording/reporting of malaria morbidity and mortality. The directorate is at present striving to come out with some acceptable model for estimation of malaria deaths.According to the \\'Lancet\\' study conducted by Indian, British and Canadian researchers, around 55,000 malaria deaths occur in early childhood, 30,000 between the age of five and 14 and 1.2 lakh from 15 to 69 years.

       " '58dbde59a3d24b6ac1ef8404': 'Mining has become a very negative word today though the industry has made many in the business millionaires who have gone on to become power brokers, politicians and black mailers. Now, don\\'t expect me to tell you that there are varieties that are \"all-in-one\" as well. That is for you to judge and find out.But they have become a black mark in society and what I call businessmen of the negative kind. For they earn in crores, and the bulk of the money they earn turns black. They do not, most often, plough back the money towards social responsibility. In fact, they do not display anything that is responsible at all. Perhaps, that word does not exist in their dictionary.The problems associated with the mining industry are common in all states where mining takes place. Some of it is legal, while most of it remains illegal. There are statistics to prove the point I am making. It is estimated that for every truck load of licenced ore transported, there are nine others which are not recorded. And the story is the same in Goa as well.Mining is fast taking away the charm of Goa, for the industry is making the green activists go red. The mining industry is a lawless industry. Information obtained under the RTI act has revealed that out of the 91 working mines in Goa, 57 are operating without any air pollution or water pollution certificates.This is two-thirds of the industry. There is no provision in the law for the Pollution Control Board to allow these mines to operate even for a single day. Also, information obtained from another RTI application reveals that 40 to 50 of the companies are operating their mines in violation of the Forest Conservation Act.As per Section 37 of the Mining Act, there is no provision to sub-contract or sub-let the mines to operators, but 33 consents have been given to operators.Roads are in bad shape, there is dust and noise pollution, and houses around the vicinity of mining areas have become unlivable. Worse, mining lords and truck owners who transport iron ore from the mines of Goa\\'s various talukas, have become brazen in their means and ways. The latest incident was the way the truck owners tried to strike down the move of the Goa transport department to discipline them when they gherraoed chief minister Digambar Kamat.Earlier, only high grade ore was exported and the business was very respectable with leading names like the Salgaocars, Chowgules, Dempos, Sesa Goa, Bandekars and Fomentos (run by the Timblos). But with the Chinese wanting low grade ores, newer companies have come in and there are several operators who have jumped the band-wagon. Goa Foundation director Claude Alvares says even among the top companies, at least 60% of the mines they are operating in have exceeded their allocated quota to mine the ores.The biggest culprits are the operators who have been given contracts for mining by the mine owners. These contractors have no responsibility and they have violated the Air and Water Act of the Pollution Control Board. These operators are individual players, many of them either being politicians or backed by politicians. This has brought a bad name to the traditional players who were in the mining business for decades.The new comers have ploughed Goa to the core and are not even leaving the coastlines. They are so blatant that mining is going on within the handshaking distance of the Selaulim dam and the wildlife sanctuaries of Goa.Mining has been rampant in Sanguem, Quepem, Molem-Usgao, Bicholim, Amona, and recently Sirsaim. Truck owners in their zest to make higher profits overload trucks carrying iron ore from the mines to the loading points. Against a permissible limit of 10 tonnes, most trucks carry more than 20 to 22 tonnes on an average per trip. Trucks put an extra plank to carry the overload.The transport director has been trying to enforce the law, but is finding it difficult due to political interference. The overload of trucks affects the environment directly causing dust pollution due to heavy spillage.Also, the roads are not able to take the load causing damage and require frequent repairs, which has a direct bearing on the exchequer and the burden is on the common man. There are over 15,000 trucks involved in the operations transporting iron ore daily.According to figures available, an estimated 45 million tons of iron ore bringing in revenues of over Rs 18,000 crore is exported annually from Goa. Out of this, the government gets Rs 700 crore as revenues from royalty. When you compare the total revenue of the mining industry, the Goa budget which is only about Rs 4,500 crore-Rs 5,000 crore looks pale, and the mining lobby obviously has more power and teeth to do what they want and get away.Many of these mines are allegedly owned by politicians or they have a stake and vested interests.Several representations to the government and appeals to the chief minister have fallen on deaf ears. Agitations by locals have not yielded results. Digambar Kamat has to answer why there is no action against irresponsible mining.One begins to wonder if he has a vested interest. Who is he trying to protect and why? What is it that prevents him from taking strong action? Is it the fear of losing his chair in Porvorim? For, the talk of the town is that if he does take action, he will lose his chair and the government will also fall. Has the government become a bonded labourer to the neo-mining lords of Goa?So the chief minister should know that his government has to order the closure of all those companies which have violated the laws. Union environment minister Jairam Ramesh has been appraised of these facts, but why is he not acting in Goa? Or is he minding his own business now for things have become too hot for the Congress all over the country? Wonder who is lording over whom now?',\n",

With the court\\'s decision, however, both millers and farmers will hope the impasse will end and normal crushing activities can begin.Till November 21, 58 mills out of the total 102 privately owned mills in UP had begun crushing sugarcane. Of the 23 government-owned mills, 10 had started crushing operations.Though the government should have declared the SAP by October 1 - before the onset of the crushing season - the declaration came nearly a month later, in the second week of November. Aimed at appeasing farmers, the declaration of SAP, however, ruffled feathers within the sugar industry, which maintained that operating mills at such high SAP was unviable. Due to the near-stable prices of sugar since last year, sugar mill owners had maintained they will be unable to pay more than Rs 205 per quintal because of low sugar prices and the restrictions on exports. By the time the state\\'s declaration came, however, several small and marginal sugarcane farmers were already making distress sales to jaggery units. Till now, nearly 20% of the state\\'s small sugarcane farmers have made distress sales to khandsari units, with sales fetching them anything between Rs 185 and Rs 210 per quintal of sugarcane sold.To resolve the issue, the Indian Sugar Mills Association and farmer groups from UP, met on Monday and decided to make a joint representation to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee. \"We have decided that ISMA and farmer groups will raise the question of viability of sugar mills in UP. We will also ask for the removal of levy, permission to export sugar and demand the disbanding of the existing release mechanism on sugar,\\'\\' said Sudhir Panwar, president Kisan Jagriti Manch, who attended the meeting in New Delhi on Monday.In 2010-11, the government had declared SAP between the Rs 205 and Rs 210 range. Farmers, on the other hand, had wanted it raised to Rs 300 to 350 per quintal.Last year, the sugar production was below 6 million tonnes and this year it is likely to increase to about 6.4 million tones. At a meeting of the state government officials and office bearers of Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), the latter said that mills could not afford to pay more than Rs 191 per quintal to survive. On Monday, the association of mill owners maintained that they will only begin crushing sugarcane if it is viable. This, they added, was because ex-mill sale price of sugar continues to remain Rs 28 per kg.',\n",

It is impossible for activists to stop the felling each instance,\" said R Raveendran. Work on felling the tree on Race Course Road began at 8.30am, according to activists. Three persons engaged by the TNEB came to the Race Course Road and cut it. \"Even before we could arrive at the scene, the tree had been brought down,\" said R Mohammed Saleem, president of Environment Conservation Group.Activists also suspect the hand of the TNEB foreman, Balachandran. \"We think they did it without obtaining permission.

       " '58dbdf09a3d24b6ac1ef8449': 'The use of industrial explosives in terror blasts has often evoked concern over government regulation of such materials.NAGPUR: The use of industrial explosives in terror blasts has often evoked concern over government regulation of such materials. The agency responsible for this regulation, the city-based Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO), however, keeps lamenting about an acute staff crunch which hampers its functioning. Therefore, any move to take some load off PESO\\'s shoulders would, logically, be welcomed.Or so one would think.A government move to ease the workload of the manpower-deficient PESO has left those in this organization rather perturbed. PESO is also the statutory body for ensuring safety of premises dealing with petroleum products. The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), under the ministry of commerce, is now considering to shift this function to the Oil Industry Safety Directorate (OISD), which comes under the ministry of petroleum. The objective is to see that PESO can focus on its primary job of regulating explosives. But this has left this organization lobbying hard against the move.Sources in the industry say that the petroleum sector, especially due to private players, is a milch cow for PESO, one that the agency is not ready to let go of so easily. It has been also learnt that certain private players, too, have backed PESO in this campaign.No matter how difficult the agency may find ensuring compliance on the explosives side, it is also keen that petroleum safety remains its domain, said a source. Bringing ammonium nitrate under the explosives act will increase its workload manifold. This chemical has been found to be used in several terror blasts, including the latest at Zaveri Bazaar in Mumbai. PESO is not faring too well on the petroleum function too, as it is able to inspect only 6% of the establishments covered, again due to the staff shortage.PESO has sent a letter to Chaitanya Prasad, the joint secretary in-charge of explosives section within the ministry of commerce, justifying why the job of petroleum safety should remain with it.Its basic contention is that since OISD is supported by the government oil companies, it is likely to create a conflict of interest leading to a bias against the private players. PESO officials say that the function has to be discharged an independent agency, and OISD is not one.It further argues that OISD only is run by officials from oil companies on deputation, with no permanent staff. It is also not a statutory organization like the PESO, says the letter.There are concerns that OISD may not have the requisite expertise in handling the job. On this, the DIPP official said that it has been assured by the ministry of petroleum that OISD will have all the necessary expertise and requirement to discharge the function properly.A senior official in the DIPP, however, said that the sole objective of transfer of functions to OISD is that PESO is able to focus on its job of regulating the explosives industry. PESO is not able to discharge this function properly due to a manpower crunch. \"A final decision has not been taken yet but the transfer is being done with the consent of both the ministries,\" the official said.PESO, in its letter to the joint secretary, admits that paucity of manpower is badly hampering its functioning. It has put up a demand for getting 399 officers from the present strength of 87. The letter adds that even as a software for receiving online returns on explosives manufacture and usage has been put in place, PESO is not in a position to process the data so as to detect any mismatch. PESO also needs substantial increase in manpower after it begins regulating ammonium nitrate.',\n",

The last 48 hours though, have been the most difficult. For ever since they entered into Kolkata, two days ago, the first-hand experience of driving through the chaotic traffic and deafening honking has rattled them.\"I have driven a bit around the world. But believe you me, nothing beats the experience of driving in Kolkata,\" said 81-year-old Manfred. Labelled as the one who \\'drives like a devil\\' by fellow adventurer and Mercedes-Benz Offroad executive Martin Breuninger, one better take the assessment seriously.Martin and Manfred are among the score-and-a-half men and women who have been travelling for the past month and a half, making their way through cities, towns, mountains and deserts in 15 Mercedes-Benz G-wagons, considered the most rugged and versatile 4x4 production vehicle in the world. The \"low\" point during the journey was when the vehicle passed through an area in China that was 98 metres below sea level. The \"high\" points were many, as they crossed six passes of over 5,000 metres. But the summit was when they reached the Everest base camp at 5,380 metres.The robust suspension came into good use during their drive along crater-riddled NH-34 from Siliguri to Kolkata. Clearly, it was one of the worst highways that they had negotiated. And they have driven quite a bit, burning rubber across 16,800 km as the vehicles journeyed from Berlin to Kolkata across the Himalayas and Ural mountains, the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts.On entering the city on Monday, the sheer volume of traffic and the wild manner in which it moved, unnerved even Karlheinz Alber, the Mercedes-Benz G-class technical specialist who has done dozens of adventure trails in the past 15 years. During the present one, he and the rest had driven through cities and towns in Germany, Poland, Latvia, Russia, Kazakhstan, China, Tibet, Nepal and Bhutan. The worst was clearly reserved for the last.\"Before the driving event, I did a pre-tour mapping of the route, three months ago. At the time, I had realized that the traffic was somewhat unruly and one couldn\\'t make one\\'s way without honking. On returning, I asked everyone to equip themselves with the loudest horn they could get for driving in Kolkata. But those were not loud enough and got drowned in the cacophony,\" said Martin.In the service vehicle that Martin and Karlheinz drive, they have installed a horn button in the centre of the dashboard so that either can use it to one\\'s convenience. \"During the previous visit, my thumb had gone sore. I had to resort to holding the steering wheel in a manner that enabled me to honk with my elbows. This time, we were better equipped. But even that didn\\'t help,\" Martin said in exasperation.After the first encounter with Kolkata traffic, the 30 adventurers appeared to have lost the appetite for the unexpected. So, instead of making the most use of the two days in the city, the couples, a father-son duo and the two Merc executives stayed ensconced in their hotel rooms and away from the madness on the streets. Even Claudeo, the youngest in the group at 18, preferred the quiet and solitude.\"The traffic is chaotic in Cairo too. But there, drivers show more sense than they do in Kolkata. Here, they are outright reckless. Even when a driver sees it is futile to rush ahead and makes sense to wait, his action defies logic. I saw a city bus taking a turn at a round about. There was no way a truck approaching from the opposite direction could also wedge through. But it still muscled in and stopped the flow. It was only when a traffic cop arrived 15 minutes later that the needless snarl could be untangled,\" Martin pointed out.There was one redeeming factor though. After sputtering its way through China and gasping in Nepal, the engines were back to normal rev in Bengal. The high sulphate content in diesel retailed in China was so bad that the particle filters got choked every 200 km. \"The fuel is definitely a lot better in India,\" said Karlheinz.Next year, he will be back in Kolkata alongside Martin as they steer yet another group of G-wagon owners to an adventure of a lifetime. Mercedes-Benz generally undertakes one mega-drive a year and it\\'s always a different one. This is the first time the company will do a repeat, given the overwhelming response of G-wagon owners. \"Given the trans-Himalayan journey, the Berlin-Himalayas-Kolkata adventure trail has many attractions. And adventure-seekers are prepared for most of them. The one they don\\'t have a clue about is the big bang experience when they enter Kolkata. It is a loud secret,\" winked Martin.',\n",

In addition to replacement retirees, banks are also hiring to replace attrition among fresh recruits and to fill positions in new branches.Speaking on the sidelines of a seminar by the Institute of Banking Personnel Selection, M V Nair, chairman, IBPS and chairman, Union Bank of India, said that banks will have openings for over four lakh jobs in coming years. At present, public sector bank employees number almost one million but a large chunk of them will retire in the next two years. Nair said that a spike in attrition was expected because of lumping of recruitments in the late 70s and early 80s following nationalization and expansion of banking services into the hinterland.According to M D Mallya, chairman, Indian Banks Association, for banks the challenge is not just to get the people but also to hire right. \"There is little evidence to show that we will be able to move out non-performers,\" he said. Mallya, who is also the chairman of Bank of Baroda, said that his bank was looking to recruit 4,000-4,500 employees during the current fiscal.Among the large banks State Bank of India, which hired over 20,000 people last year, is set to hire over 7,000 more this fiscal. Union Bank plans to add another 3,400 to its headcount. Most of these numbers are based on growth plans. Union Bank plans to add 400 branches and State Bank of India plans to add another 1,000 branches this fiscal.Identifying human resources as a challenge, the government has set up a committee headed by Anil Khandelwal, the former chairman of Bank of Baroda. The Khandelwal committee had recommended radical measures which included increasing the retirement age and scrapping the practice of wage negotiations with unions.Subsequently the government appointed a committee headed by Atul Nigam, joint secretary, ministry of finance, to look into the implementation of the earlier report. Nair is a member of both panels. \"The government has decided to go in for a joint examination for all public sector banks which will make recruitment more efficient,\" said Nair.\"Last year, IBPS helped banks recruit around 48,000 employees. This year, going by the requirement, we expect the number to be much higher,\" said M Balachandran, director, IBPS. Banks are also hiring more than the actual vacancies because they are discovering that unlike the past, when most recruits stayed until retirement, a large number of new recruits quit in the first year itself. Delivering the valedictory address at the seminar, KC Chakrabarty, deputy governor, RBI said that banks should look at rural areas for recruitments considering that this is where a large number of new customers are expected to come from.',\n",

The groups claim that the move does not allow for Mumbai\\'s unique rental system and might leave lakhs of Mumbaikars homeless.Prepared by the Union housing ministry, the draft Model Residential Tenancy Act, 2011, intends to replace antiquated rent control legislations that cap rents. These legislations have, over the years, resulted in landlords getting only a pittance for their prime properties in metros.The draft legislation proposes that the rent for all new tenancies be based on an agreement between the landlord and the tenant. And in cases where the rent was finalized years ago, a freeze be levied on revision for 24 months. In the 22nd month, however, the landlord can seek a revision. And, if there is no agreement, the landlord can terminate the tenancy.Tenant associations claim that the new law would spell disaster for Mumbai, where thousands of old properties are still rented out under the long-standing \\'pagdi\\' system. Under this practice, the tenant pays a big non-refundable lump sum at market rate at the beginning with the understanding that the landlord will charge only a minimal rent.If the new law goes through, these tenants will have to pay rents at nearer to market rates.Advocate S N Shroff, who is an expert on tenancy laws, lamented the provisions in the proposed legislation that empower landlords to evict tenants by giving a notice.\"Lakhs of tenants in Mumbai and Pune will be left at the mercy of landlords. There are 19,000 cessed properties in the island city alone and all of them are tenanted properties,\" Shroff said. \"If the law is accepted in Maharashtra, it would mean that a majority of those living in these properties would be thrown out. No government can afford such a situation.\"Utsal Karani, a member of the Action Committee for Protection of Tenants\\' Rights, argued that it would be difficult to implement the law in Mumbai and Pune. \"The government is providing free housing to slumdwellers and encroachers. It cannot evict lakhs of tenants who have paid pagdi and have been paying taxes and cesses to the municipal and state authorities,\" he said.Shroff pointed out that most of the old properties stand on land owned and leased by the state government, municipal bodies or the Port Trust etc. The landlords themselves have been enjoying long leases, paying small lease rentals. \"Under the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999, landlords are in any case permitted to charge market rents if the premises is not let out for a year,\" he said.Milind Deora, the MP from South Mumbai, said he would write to chief minister Prithviraj Chavan to protect economically weaker tenants. \"I will also urge the state government to find a win-win solution for both tenants and landlords,\" he said.Landlords, meanwhile, welcomed the Centre\\'s move. \"There is a housing shortage in the city and the country.

The state government is yet to announce the new rule which makes a 50% score in B Com or BCA mandatory for admission into these courses, fearing a poor turnout of students.Icet officials have already calculated a 15 to 20% dip in the enrolment rate if the rule gets implemented. \"The mere announcement of the rule had brought down the number of applications for these courses by 15% (from 1.7 lakh to 1.5 lakh). If the AICTE norms are followed during admissions, half the MBA and MCA colleges will get no students,\" said an Icet official. Besides, Icet (entrance for MBA and MCA admissions) officials said that not many students who wrote the examination this year had scored 50% marks in their B Com and BCA final examinations. About 1.4 lakh students had appeared for Icet on May 18.The AICTE rule has come at a time when the general interest in the course among students has gone down considerably. In 2010, about 30% of the students who cracked Icet had not taken admissions in these colleges.AICTE had issued a circular in January 2011 and had conducted workshops in the state to familiarise college managements and state government with the rule but the higher education department is yet to act. Sources said the government is under pressure from private college managements to not implement the rule as they are worried about a drop in the number of admissions next year.Officials said that to fend off AICTE norms, the state might bring about an amendment to the Higher Education Act 1965 (last amended in 1998) which would help in bringing down the council\\'s power. \"The state has been debating the issue since the past few months. The government wants to curb AICTE\\'s control over matters including sanction of colleges and also admission of students,\" said an official from higher education department. The amendment is expected to be brought about within a few months.The private college managements in the state are up in arms against the AICTE rule, officials said. \"There is a lot of pressure on the government to not issue the GO as this will bring down the enrolment numbers. Most of the students studying in MBA and MCA colleges are covered under the fee reimbursement scheme and hence, colleges think that the implementation of the rule will reduce their profit margins,\" said an official from the department.Also, several political party representatives, MLAs and MPs own professional colleges, making the government more reluctant to implement the rule.',\n",

Further, the Zimbabwe diamonds have come under international embargo after US and EU opposed the unilateral decision taken in March-2011 by KP chairman Mathieu Yamba to allow Zimbabwe to export its diamonds.A communiquA from SAD-PMR to its members said the country was rallying behind its beleaguered neighbour, a position that appears to support the stance taken by diamond producers from the African continent.\"South Africa has taken a position in support of Zimbabwe regarding exports of rough diamonds.

It is a comprehensive appraisal of the student and person, a far cry from the conventional array of academic percentages.The report card for the Central Board of Secondary Education's (CBSE) Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation programme assesses almost every skill one could associate with a student.With only the grades out now, students are waiting impatiently for this novel report card, which gives a peek into the student's overall performance -- scholastic and non-scholastic. While the first page opens to the student's goals, strengths, interests and hobbies, along with achievements, the pages that follow give space to assess any other skills.Part one is about the academic performance which is assessed through two exams. While the first is conducted at the school level, the second exam held in April is optional -- the student could opt for boards or the exam held by the school.Part two looks into co-scholastic features -- life skills of creative and critical thinking, problem solving, decision-making and self-awareness, emotional skills of coping with stress, emotions and attitude towards teachers, classmates, environment and value system.There's an assessment of literary and creative skills, scientific skills, aesthetic skills and performing arts and clubs. This is assessed through debates, declamation, poster making, sculpture, puppetry, folk art forms etc.There's also health and physical education, including swimming, yoga, first aid and gardening, besides a space to comment on the student's physical stature and even oral hygiene.The final grade is a combination of both scholastic and co-scholastic assessment (60% and 40% respectively).

Said Delhi transport minister Arvinder Singh, \"This is part of our efforts for integrating the public transport system. We hope it will encourage people to use public transport more, since planning the travel route will become easier and clearer with this information.\" Singh admitted that at present, integration between the various modes of travel left a lot to be desired.However, with the information readily available at the bus Q shelters, the department is hoping that planning the journey will become easier. Said a senior official, \"Information on which bus route goes to a metro station is not available in the public domain at present. Once this is available, journeys will be easier to plan.\" The move also becomes important in view of the fact that the next integrated transit corridor (ITC) coming up between Karawal Nagar-Shastri Park has been designed as an integrated corridor, with links to metro stations on the way. The integrated transit concept has been the basis of most new projects, especially as the centre has been advocating transit oriented design for cities like Delhi.Interestingly, the bus Q shelters will also have information on the important destinations on the route. Earlier, Blueline buses had the information painted on the sides of the buses. However, the new buses don\\'t have this information, which will now be displayed in the bus Q shelter instead.

The reason to fly to a foreign country could have been better medical facilities, a friend\\'s advice or just the comfort factor. The southern star\\'s case was a classic case of emergency. ( Check out the latest buzz from the NRI and visa world However, there are many patients - especially expatriates - who plan their surgeries or medical treatment in foreign countries or cities to benefit from lower healthcare costs without any compromise on the quality of the treatment.Just as working professionals mix business with pleasure, individuals have the option of mixing health with pleasure. An individual residing in the US or Europe can seek medical attention in India or other South Asian countries such as Singapore at just a fraction of the price back home. It could be a heart ailment, orthopaedic problem or even a cosmetic surgery. The idea is to fly to a country with a lower medical inflation, which reduces your overall bill amount. What\\'s more, you also get a chance to tour that country!\"It is a good option for people staying abroad, who are not insured/underinsured because of the high cost differential in medical facilities between India and other countries,\" says Rahul Aggarwal, CEO of Optima Insurance Brokers. \"In the UK for instance, every medical treatment has to be routed via the NHS (National Health Service). There are few options when it comes to private doctors in the UK. As a result, a patient has to wait for a very long time to get his/her turn.Hence, countries such as India and Singapore have a clear edge over western countries, both in terms of the number of hospitals and the cost advantage,\" says Aggarwal. Within India, an individual can think of going to only smaller towns, which may come with a host of other issues. \"The social overhead cost of smaller towns is lower because of cheaper paramedical staff cost and outdated equipment, which can compromise the overall quality of treatment,\" says Aggarwal.New Delhi gets the maximum medical tourists as it is the capital and has better air connectivity. After New Delhi, the preferred destinations are Chennai and Hyderabad, say experts.\"You have to identify the country and a city with good and easy air connectivity,\" says Raj Raina, deputy general manager - marketing, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals. \"Secondly, you should identify a hospital depending upon the availability of the treatment, the cost and the success rate. Lastly, you must check the creden-tials of the hospital/consultants (JCI, UK or US Board Certified),\" he says.\"Patients from the the US, UK and Europe give a lot of importance to JCI accreditation.\" \"I would advise patient to give more importance to the doctor than the hospital,\" says Radhakrishna Chamarty, director of India Insure Risk Management and Insurance Broking Services. \"The surgeon or the specialist makes a bigger difference than the hospital.

Blackstone Advisors India Private Ltd has invested $1.7 billion in the country since 2006.Blackstone had pumped in $105 million to back a management buyout of Intelenet in 2007. The marquee PE investor, which made follow-on investments, almost quadrupled that money when Serco acquired Intelenet with an enterprise valuation of $634 million (inclusive of contingent payments) on Tuesday.\"What we have seen today is a quintessential private equity story. Blackstone enhanced Intelenet\\'s performance by adding value and created wealth for everyone involved. Nearly 80 odd senior management staff held around 16% of the company stock,\" Akhil Gupta, CMD, Blackstone Advisors India Pvt Ltd, told TOI. \"It is significant to note that 27% of Intelenet\\'s revenues came from Blackstone\\'s portfolio clients pointing to our value addition,\" Gupta added soon after the firm\\'s first \\'big exit\\' in India.Intelenet\\'s senior management, led by CEO Susir Kumar, would unlock about $100 million in value following the transaction, making it a windfall for the private equity backed professional entrepreneurs.

Actis sold Paras Pharmaceuticals to UK\\'s Reckitt Benckiser for $726 million in December 2010, unlocking huge gains for some top honchos, including S Raghunandan who steered the firm as CEO.This deal will be a case study of classic PE/management buyout in India.

Intelenet almost doubled its headcount to 30,000 and set up operations in seven countries globally.Blacktone pulled off handsome returns on an investment clinched at peak valuation during the bull run years. \"This reaffirms our faith in the macro story. We focus on investment thesis, good management and performance enhancement. We have investments in our portfolio, ranging between six months to five years, and we are happy with the way they have performed irrespective of what we read in media sometimes,\" Gupta said. Some of Blackstone\\'s investments, like the buyout of Gokaldas Exports, have been hotly debated \\'contrarian\\' deals in the recent past.\"Blackstone was quite keen on showing return on investments in India, especially when they are in fund-raising mode.

The connections were disconnected due to a fire in the building in March this year, but despite repeated complaints to MTNL the lines were not re-activated, forcing the lawyers to seek redressal from court.The advocates were further enraged when despite the connection having been disrupted, they continued to receive hefty monthly bills from the department that included charges for internet usage.In fact, after the lawyers went to court and Justice Hima Kohli issued notice to MTNL and the state government, the lines were restored the very next day. However, the court took a very grim view of the matter and decided to keep it pending and pursue the same to find out what was the reason for the slow response of the telecom agency.Filing a petition against MTNL inaction, one of the advocates Ashok Agarwal apprised the court that it was only after exhausting every possible remedy did the lawyers petition HC. If this was the cavalier manner in which MTNL treated complaints for restoration of lines within HC premises, the petition wondered what must be the plight of the common man. The petition sought a decisive intervention from the court.It pointed out that absence of a landline resulted in delay in legal work scheduled before the courts, which ultimately affected the litigants because very often key documents were not tabled due to communication gap between lawyers and their staff placed in the chambers.

Tomorrow: The drug trade flourishes in Hyderabad aided by a ninept reg ulatory body)HYDERABAD: Junior Tollywood artistes by day and drug peddlers by night. That\\'s how the \"resume\" of several cocaine dealers in the city reads - a good chunk of whom are from African countries such as Nigeria, Uganda and Kenya, apart from Omanis, Thais and your local Hyderabadi. Agents from this small yet wellconnected network of peddlers, spread across Masab Tank, Mehdipatnam, Sainikpuri and Yapral, are the ones who supply our Tollywood\\'s \"snorting celebs\" their daily dose of coke.In fact, under the pretext of business and education, the number of foreign peddlers, especially from Africa, gaining entry into Hyderabad has been steadily rising each year. For example, Osmania University figures show that close to 1,500 of their 3,300 (approx) foreign students are from Africa. The varsity expects these numbers to go up this year.While cops claim to be cracking down on African nationals overstaying on student visa, the easy money in drug dealing is attracting more people into the racket. And their population is bloating by the day. Police and immigration records show that of the 28,700 foreigners in Hyderabad since 2005, 10,033 are from Africa.Porous African borders, easy availability of cocaine, and lax local drug laws make African nationals the most common peddlers in Hyderabad. India, say investigating officials, is a market with potential for peddlers as punishment is not as severe as in the Middle East or China and also has a huge affluent population that likes the \"high\" life.But not everyone who steps out of their African homes intends to be a peddler. \"They usually come here to escape the misery back home and smuggle the drug for their use. They soon realize that it\\'s a profitable business, turn into drug mules and start supplying it,\" says an official, adding that a Nigerian drug lord who supplies to peddlers in Hyderabad via his Mumbai contacts has been identified. Once in the city, the foreign peddlers using local contacts begin as small-time drug couriers before graduating to supplying drugs to high-flying clients. To build contacts within the film fraternity, these peddlers often double up as junior artistes on the sets of big productions that also add to their daily earnings. \"We usually hire a lot of these Africans for crowd scenes. They are cheap labour (paid about Rs 2,000 per day) and are usually supplied by model coordinators operating locally,\" says a well-known producer.Narrating how these peddlers make their way into the vanity vans of stars, he says: \"Once on the sets, they chat up these stars and if they appear to be prospective customers, they broach the subject and even strike deals.\"Deals are done inside greenrooms, private vans of celebs, deserted streets or even a few plush pubs in the city. The peddlers carry the cocaine packed in thin polythene packets, often hidden inside their rectum or throat. While actors deal with peddlers through their assistant, the female leads of Tollywood thrillers are known to deal with them directly, often because they are not locally connected.Following the crackdown, both celebs and peddlers are now playing safe. In a change of modus operandi, a peddler may now deliver to a pre-planned spot, another group collects the money from a different location and a third team keeps a watch on cops. \"The peddlers turn up only after their surveillance team confirms it is safe,\" says a source from the special team.',\n",

The directive is apparently aimed done as a protest against the state transport department not allowing black-and-yellow taxis to operate as two-in-one cabs (AC and non-AC) in Mumbai.Quadros said on Tuesday, \"There were mixed reactions to the union\\'s call. Many drivers are unaware about my directive and it will take seven to eight days to convince them.\"There are 14,000 black-and-yellow taxis fitted with ACs-8,000 WagonRs and 5,000 Santros and the rest being Maruti Eeco, Alto and other models.Quadros said the traffic police were opposed to his directive. \"I have written a letter to all divisional traffic inspectors, seeking clarity on the Motor Vehicle Act. We are not violating any clause of the Act as air-conditioners are already fitted in the cabs at the time of registration. We can switch it on for passengers and this is not illegal.\" He further stated that the State Transport Authority had in 2008 recommended that all black-and-yellow taxis should be \"modernised.\" \"What do you mean by modernisation? If we switch on AC and give passengers value for money, why are the cops opposing it?\" he asked.He has threatened to agitate in front of traffic cops if they stop drivers of Santros and WagonRs taxis for switching on the AC. \"If everything fails, I will challenge the issue in the Bombay high court.\" He stated that 80 per cent drivers ferried regular office-goers during peak hours. \"These passengers will benefit from the AC and if pleased, they can tip the driver extra money. Accepting a tip is not an offence,\\'\\' he stated.Taxi driver Munna Khan, who refused to switch on the AC of his Santro, said, \"I don\\'t understand why Quadros wants us to give complimentary rides to passengers.We will incur losses if the AC is switched on for the same fare.\" he pointed out. Devang Somaiya, a passenger from Mulund, said it was good to get extra AC comfort for the same price and welcomed the decision.A senior RTO official dubbed it as a \"ploy\" by Quadros to seek public sympathy and build pressure against the government. \"Quadros fears that there would be a decline in the population of black-and-yellow taxis as the government has not been issuing fresh permits to these drivers. Since new permits have been issued to only AC and fleet taxis, Quadros wants all black-and-yellow taxis to have AC facility,\" he said. , adding, \"It is the jungle law -- survival of the fittest.\"',\n",

The project, a first for the city, will see biogas generated at sewage treatment plants being converted into CNG. Delhi at present has the largest fleet of CNG-run buses in the world. The biogas produced by the sewage treatment plants has a 60 per cent concentration of methane. For CNG, it has to be concentrated up to 90 per cent.The project, set to begin by September this year, will be carried out as a joint venture between the Swedish and Delhi governments. The project has been granted an in-principle approval. The government will get 50 per cent funding for the project from Swedish Development Corporation Agency, and will pay for the rest.The project is being spearheaded by the Efficiency and Renewable Energy Management Centre. Sources in the government said that the Delhi government began talks with the Swedish government in December 2010, following which Swedish experts conducted a three-month study of four sewage treatment plants in Delhi  Dwarka, Keshopur, Coronation Park and Okhla.The other plants were in disrepair or were too old. Based on the condition of the plant, the experts have finally zeroed in on the Keshopur plant. If successful, the government may replicate the project in all 17 STPs of the capital. This, say officials, will be able to meet the CNG requirement for a large part of the DTC fleet. One of the main criteria needed for setting up such plants is the presence of a CNG filling station within accessible distance of the plant.

The insightful responses to the blogfest go to show that this is a subject with which people across age and background can connect.Neela Bhagwat, artist and performer at the festival remarks, \"I believe Kabir\\'s mysticism is simply an intense love for humanity. What his poetry does is remind us of a common humanity.\"For more information on the Kabir festival events, go to www.thekabirfest.com and http://tulikapublishers.blogspot.com/2011/01/kabir-blogfest-is-on.html.

A total of 731 km of drain will be constructed in this phase.K. Boopathy, Superintending Engineer, says the width of the drains has been decided based on rainfall in the catchment area. The engineers studied the rainfall intensity and topography before deciding on the width. They also took into account the slope of the area the drain will cover.The civic body's original proposal to the Union Government was for Rs. 1,082 crore and that included concrete lining all the natural drains within the city limits.The aim was to cover 40 km, says Mr. Boopathy.

These innovative banking operations are underway in Bharatpur, Alwar, Dholpur, Karauli, Dausa and Sawai Madhopur districts.Lupin Foundation executive director Sita Ram Gupta said here on Sunday that the banking services had transformed the lives of thousands of farmers, labourers and women who earlier did not have access to banking institutions: Women in interior villages earlier did not have even rudimentary knowledge of banking system. They kept [their] savings in boxes at home. In addition to the customer service agents, the foundation has also appointed 32 technical service providers for issuing smart cards to the rural customers. These operators feed biometric data of new customers in the enrolment devices and send it to an e-business service firm in Hyderabad, which prepares the smart cards.Over 100 POS machines supplied by Hyderabad-based Batronics India Limited are taken regularly to villages, with some of them temporarily installed and activated by operators, and the data and photographs of customers are collected and authenticated.Mr. Gupta pointed out that a total of 83,974 savings accounts had been opened in about 630 villages of the six districts and smart cards supplied to 54,000 customers.The thumb impression of a customer is obtained on the POS machine for an immediate display of his or her details on the screen. After this, a customer can easily make banking transactions and the details are supplied on a fixed day every week.Mr. Gupta affirmed that the biggest advantage of providing banking services through the financial inclusion scheme was that the villagers did not have to travel long distances to the bank branches in cities.

       " '58dc0c6fa3d24b212cfb69a2': \"The Bharatiya Janata Party would demand a full debate in Parliament during the monsoon session on the pricing of petroleum products, and a rational energy policy, senior party leader Murli Manohar Joshi said here on Monday.Referring to the recent increase in the prices of diesel, kerosene and cooking gas, he said it was time the government had a policy on pricing, based on a well-thought out formula, given the considerably high prices of international crude oil. Dr. Joshi admitted that during the six-year rule of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (1998 to 2004), no rational formula for pricing was worked out; nor was there an energy policy. But why talk about what happened in the past. We should move on. We must discuss what we need to do now.Duties on petroleum products, he said, constituted 25 per cent of the government's total revenue, and it was used to balance the budget and keep the fiscal deficit within limits. A whopping Rs. 1,35,000 crore accrued to the government from the duties and taxes and, of this, roughly Rs. 55,000 crore was collected by the States. Since the subsidy on these products came to about Rs.40,400 crore, the Centre collected a revenue of just under Rs.40,000 crore on petrol, diesel, kerosene, cooking gas and a host of other products.The Centre's excuse for increasing the prices was that the subsidies were now beyond bearable limits. This was fallacious, as overall the government was still getting revenue from the petroleum products, he said.Dr. Joshi did not directly respond to questions whether the BJP-ruled States would follow the example of West Bengal, Kerala and Delhi and cut taxes to reduce the burden of higher prices on people. We will ask our Chief Ministers and Finance Ministers to discuss the issue with the Centre.What he argued for was a good and open debate in Parliament and then transparency on what the actual cost is  taking into account the high prices of international crude  and a rational formula for fixing the retail prices. Contrary to the government's claims, Dr. Joshi said, oil companies were generating good profits and certainly not in the red.On the issues before the Public Accounts Committee, he said that at a meeting scheduled for Tuesday, he would place the letter from the Speaker rejecting the draft report on the 2G spectrum allocation scam, which he had sent to her. He maintained that the report was valid as it had been approved by the committee. It would be up to the committee to decide what to do with that report.\",\n",

Violations have even led to impounding of the buses, he added.More than 4,300 DTC buses have been fined this year until September, whereas 1,972 prosecutions were reported during the same period last year. We have also filed criminal cases against Blueline buses for forged permits, added Mr. Garg.Speaking about the reasons for high number of traffic violations in Delhi, Mr. Garg said: Non revision of penalties since 1988 under the Motor Vehicle Act for various traffic violations is one of the major reasons for accidents and traffic violations in Delhi. The fines need to be increased, [the process of] issuing of driving licences and vehicle fitness certification process need to be made stringent.The seminar was part of the three-day traffic safety expo Intertraffic that began here on Monday and participants include road safety experts from over 20 countries.',\n",

At right is the seated Buddha, a masterpiece in metal with musicians playing various instruments around him. This bronze, about 52 cm tall, establishes that the Sellur Collection belongs to the Mahayana Buddhism. Photos: V. GanesanIt is a Buddha sculpture in metal only 52 cm tall. But it is a masterpiece in the detail it contains.The Buddha is seated on a throne, his right hand in the upadesa mudra and an umbrella high above his head. An  ushnisha  (flame of knowledge) is prominent on his head and the creepers around the umbrella signify the Bodhi tree. Around the Buddha, in the outer row, is a full orchestra  several men are playing the lute and other stringed instruments, a couple of them are playing percussion instruments like the  mridangam and there is also a rasika with his hand stretched out and enjoying the music. In the inner circle are two  ganas , four devotees, two of whom are standing and two kneeling, all with folded hands, and a pair of prancing Yalis . Four more devotees (not seen in the picture), each kneeling in a corner, bear on their shoulders the throne.Priceless treasure-troveThis masterpiece was among the 42 stunning Buddha bronzes and three Buddha artefacts in stone on display for the first time at the Government Museum, Egmore, Chennai, on December 21 and 22. T. Ramalingam, a farmer and son of Thambusamy Padayachi, found this priceless treasure-trove in 2004 when labourers were digging his plot to lay the foundation for his house at South Street, Sellur village, Kodavasal taluq, Tiruvarur district, Tamil Nadu. They are all datable to the 11{+t}{+h}century C.E. to 13{+t}{+h}century C.E. and belong to the Chola period.The 45 artefacts form an impressive addition to the Nagapattinam Collection of 350 Buddha bronzes, which were discovered between 1856 and the 1930s at Vellipalayam and Nanayakkara Street in Nagapattinam, where Buddhism thrived in Tamil Nadu.Highly ornamentedThe Sellur artefacts range in height from 7 cm to about 52 cm. The collection includes three Maitreya figurines. Highly ornamented, the right hand in all the three is in the  abhaya mudra  and the left holds a  naga pushpa . There are Lokesvara and Avalokitesvaras as well. (Avalokitesvara, also called Lokesvara, is a Bodhisattva  one who has nearly attained Buddhahood but prefers to serve the public, embodying the compassion of the Buddha. Maitreya is the Buddha who will appear in the world in the future). The Buddhas in stone include those in white marble and slate stone. There is a Buddha in metal, with an inscription in Tamil on the pedestal, datable to the Chola period. The script has not been read yet.The 45 artefacts were till now in the Kodavasal taluq office. S.S. Jawahar, Commissioner of Museums, Tamil Nadu, initiated the steps to bring them to Chennai and display them to the public. The exhibition was organised so that people will come to know what a wonderful collection of Buddha bronzes Tamil Nadu has, R. Balasubramanian, Curator (archaeology), Government Museum, Chennai, said.R. Nagaswamy, reputed iconographer and former Director, Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department, said the seated Buddha with musicians, followers and yalis around him was an interesting and a very important find. The entire Sellur Collection belonged to Mahayana Buddhism, which believed in worshipping the Buddha in form and portrayed Avalokitesvara, Lokesvara, Maitreya and others, and used more of Sanskrit, Dr. Nagaswamy explained.Another bronze of extraordinary workmanship found in the Sellur collection is a votive stupa, about 30 cm tall. On the base of the stupa, around the four sides, are tales from the Buddha's life. On the one side is Nalagiri, the mad elephant kneeling before the Buddha on hearing his voice, and the Buddha calming it with his hand. On another side is the Buddha preaching his very first sermon, after his Enlightenment, in the Deer Park of Isipatana, now called Sarnath, near Varanasi. Below him is a Dharma Chakra, flanked by two deer and followers with folded hands. Below this panel is a standing Buddha, with an attendant holding a parasol with a tall stem above the Buddha's head. On another side is the Buddha in Maha Parinirvana, that is after his death. On the fourth side is a seated Buddha, with his right hand in  bhoomi sparisa  mudra. On top of this base is the circular  anda and above it is the  harmika or the tiered vimana. Lift the anda and the harmika and, lo and behold, there emerges a tiny seated Buddha.A rare votive stupaMr. Balsubramanian called it a rare votive stupa. Its style and the Jataka tales sculpted on its sides had a close affinity to the Maha Chaitya found at Amaravathy, near Guntur, Andhra Pradesh.Perhaps, the Chola craftsman had visited Amaravathy before he did his piece in metal, he surmised.This votive stupa was another clear-cut demonstration that the Sellur collection belonged to Mahayana Buddhism, Dr. Nagaswamy said.The Sellur discoveries are definitely important and they increase our knowledge of Buddhism in Tamil Nadu. They establish again that Buddhism was prevalent in the interior areas of Tamil Nadu such as Kanchipuram, Jayamkondan and Thyaganur near Salem besides the coastal areas such as Nagapattinam and Mylapore, Dr. Nagaswamy said.They are an impressive addition to Nagapattinam Collection of 350 Buddha bronzesSeated Buddha with musicians, followers and yalis around a important find\",\n",

But the AIC has not made any modifications to the scheme, the officials said.As per the existing scheme, a grower and the Horticulture Department of the State have to contribute 25 per cent each of the premium, while the Coconut Development Board (CDB) would share the balance.

Cultivation of other vegetables too is in no better position.Preliminary estimatesAccording to the preliminary estimates prepared by the department, horticultural crops spanning across an extent of 7, 829 hectares in the district have suffered damage, of which the share of vegetables is 6, 671 hectares. Calculated against the total extent of vegetables' cultivation, the damage accounts for 20 per cent.Once the detailed reports are prepared, the crop loss could stand to be much higher than projected in the preliminary estimates, says the Assistant Director of Horticulture, Ranga Reddy, K.Neeraja Gandhi.As of now, reports are being prepared for the two crop seasons of the year, but loss per hectare could go up in a major way if the actual production span is taken into consideration, she says.Comparatively, fruits suffered lesser loss as their yield is seasonal and the need for fresh sowing is ruled out. Nevertheless, the crops of papaya and guava suffered considerably.CompensationBased on preliminary reports, proposals for a total compensation of Rs.3.44-crore are being sent, which would be spent on providing input subsidies.

But, an innovative concept has reduced all this into miniature tools and lab wares that could fit in to a small box.According to Professor H.O. Gupta, Department of Education in Science and Mathematics, National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), New Delhi, who introduced this technique to schools, the micro scale kit needed lesser amount of chemicals and was cost-effective. It would suit the needs of schools with poor lab facilities while ensuring a safe learning atmosphere for students, he said. Mr. Gupta says that the model was student, environment, administrator and teacher friendly, and it did not compromise on the quality and standard of experiments.The revolving circular racks on top of the box hold plastic bottles that dispensed one drop of liquid at a time. The kit, which could serve as a mobile laboratory, could be used by four students at a time without even moving from their places. Mr. Gupta has also introduced a W-tube, a miniature apparatus, to conduct experiments. A small kerosene lamp was also provided with the kit, he said.International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) had undertaken projects to design micro-scale kits and train teachers to introduce the method in schools in the country. The micro scale experiments had been adapted by many institutes such as University of Mumbai, University of Pune and Goa University, almost a decade before. According to NCERT, the method was eco-friendly as it used less quantity of chemicals.Large quantities of chemicals were thrown away after the experiments in traditional labs. But, this system did not have a sink and there was very little wastage.According to Mr. Gupta, the theory based on exploration, experimentation and transformation, was intended to encourage students to explore and conduct experiments on their own which would help them understand and apply the knowledge in different situations.The micro scale tool kit introduced by NCERT in 2005 had been adopted by schools in many states and Union Territories, including New Delhi, Bihar, Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir and Jharkhand, but was yet to gain popularity in the South. The Southern Regional Micro Scale Chemistry Laboratory, which acts as a nodal centre for labs in the south, was launched at the Regional Institute of Mysore, in 2007.According to D. Prabhakaran, principal, Kendriya Vidyalaya, Sowripalayam, based on the information given by the CBSE, the school had placed orders for the kit and it would be implemented from the next academic year.',\n",

Such unjustified' protectionist steps are making the environment difficult there for businesses of this country, it said.In a statement issued here, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) hoped that the U.S. would revise its stance on targeting Indian companies, especially given the increasing volume of investments and jobs they are creating for the U.S. economy. The CII is deeply concerned over the rising costs and increasingly terse business environment for Indian companies operating in the U.S., particularly in the pharmaceutical and IT sphere,'' CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said in a statement.Referring to the new U.S. Health Bill that provides for imposition of 2 per cent excise duty on goods and services imported by the U.S. government from countries like India and China, which are outside the purview of WTO's agreement on government procurement, it said the U.S. was unfairly targeting foreign companies to pay for domestic imperatives, which is unjustified. It said the provisions in the Bill amount to absurdity' as it would be akin to India requiring U.S. companies to pay for healthcare compensation of victims of the 26/11 terrorist attacks in Mumbai. The CII was also critical of the U.S. government's decision to extend the hiked visa fees under the Border Security Bill that would impact Indian professionals. U.S. President Barack Obama signed the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act on January 3, which provides compensation for treatment of victims of 9/11 terrorist attacks.The estimated budget ($4.2 billion) will be funded by continuation of an increased fee on certain categories of H-1B and L1 visas. The visa fee hike, under the U.S. Border Security provisions, was valid till 2014. The move would mainly impact Indian IT companies, which earn about 60 per cent of there $50 billion revenue from exports to America.Mr. Banerjee said that apart from internal laws, the U.S. has been a strong proponent of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA).Under ACTA, the border and customs authorities can seize goods suspected' of violating intellectual property related laws, even if such goods are in transit to another destination where they may be acceptable.\",\n",

The answer seems to be in affirmative if one goes through outcomes of research, which has been conducted on flood-affected families in Jagatsinghpur district during three consecutive years.The children have two times more chances of suffering from chronic malnutrition when they live in recurrent flood-affected areas in comparison to the non-affected areas, says the study conducted by Voluntary Health Association of India-Aparajita, a city-based voluntary organisation.The study on 328 children aged 6-59 months say that 11.4 per cent of the children are severely stunted (child is short for his/her age but not necessarily thin; this is a condition of chronic malnutrition) in flooded areas whereas 6.5 per cent in non-flooded areas.Seventeen other factors under the broad heads of demographics, socio-economic, water security, and immunisation were used to detect other risk factors affecting stunting. These factors had insignificant effect on stunting, said Shisir Ranjan Dash, the principal researcher for this project.The survey covered 758 families in the flood-affected areas and 816 families from non-flooded areas in 32 villages in the blocks of Kujanga, Balikuda, Tirtol, Ersama and Biridi under MICRODIS, a global initiative to assess the impact of disasters on vulnerable communities.This survey was done in 2008 and again in 2009 and 2010 to compare the impacts of disaster in long run.The anthropometric measurement of the children in 2009 shows that wasting and under weight contributing to acute malnutrition is as much as three times higher among children of the flood-affected areas in comparison to that of the non-affected areas, the study says.It points out that the sanitation condition was deplorable in the post flood period accounting to 81.61 per cent open defecation.The study also charts out several public health challenges saying before disasters about 93.54 per cent people were using tubewell water and the usage decreased to 59.76 per cent after disaster.Similarly, 38.92 per cent of people were using public pond for bathing before disaster that increased 56.46 per cent after disaster.The study recommends since chronic malnutrition is the main problem, long-term and sustainable intervention must be put in place to address the problem.Addressing a workshop marking sharing of research outcome here on Friday, State Health and Family Welfare Minister Prasanna Acharya said the State government would give due attention to strengthen the health care system in emergency time.

KumarIncreasing public financing for health care, allotting 70 per cent of funds for primary health care and regulating drug prices are the key factors that would go towards providing universal health coverage in India, K. Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India has said.Tax funds must be the principal source of health funding, with insurance and employer contributions being minor funding sources, Prof. Reddy said. While India's per capita health spend is about $100, the public contribution is only about $19. Much of it is out of pocket expenditure for the patient, he said delivering the 2011 Guhan Memorial Lecture, organised by the Citizen consumer and civic Action Group (CAG).Unfortunately, in India, health care is a great cause of impoverishment and exacerbation of poverty. India is a country in which 39 million people are pushed into poverty every year because of health care costs. Several more are teetering on the brink, Prof. Reddy stated. Clearly, it is imperative to look at a health care system that is more efficient, effective and equitable.Public health spending has remained stagnant at about one percent of the GDP, but since the GDP has increased, more funds than before are now available for health spending. However this has not translated into better health care facilities, as most of the money has been plunged into tertiary care, instead of primary care, and state-led insurance schemes that are focused only on tertiary care.For instance, in Andhra Pradesh, about 55 per cent of the health budget goes to tertiary care; and in Delhi and Tamil Nadu, it is crossing 50 per cent. If we do not articulate at this point in the rational need for a universal health care system now, many States will follow suit and start developing these insurance programmes which will be difficult to withdraw later.The need to regulate drugs is pivotal to achieving universal health care, Prof. Reddy stressed. Medicines account for 72 per cent of health care costs, so these costs need to be pegged down. Also with data exclusivity being inscribed into some of the free trade agreements in Europe, the Indian pharma industry and its ability to provide low-cost generic drugs will be crippled, he added.However, quick wins in reducing health costs can be achieved by replicating the institution of Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation (TNMSC) throughout the country. TNMSC has an excellent system for procurement and distribution of drugs. Prof. Reddy also suggested providing price controls right from the wholesale pharmacist to the retailer and that a network of public pharmacies be built up across the country. Universal health care has been the subject of the WHO's report of 2010, Prof. Reddy said. Many of the countries in the world have taken up universal health care as a policy imperative and India must wake up to this reality, he said.State-driven system stressedM.K. Mani, chief nephrologist, Apollo Hospitals, recommended a nationalised system of medicine where every doctor would work for the government. All medical care would come then from the State, instead of the present system of two distinct set of institutions in the private and health care domains.He stressed the need to focus on prevention and means of keeping the costs of treatment low. The Kidney Help Trust was seeking to prevent kidney disease in a group of people by providing for early detection of diabetes and hypertension. This had led to reduction in the incidence of chronic kidney disease from 28 per 1000 to 11 per 1000 population.N.L. Rajah, and Arjun Rajagopalan, trustees, CAG, also spoke.\",\n",

Further, the proposed site was prone to severe inundation even during off-season light showers, they claimed.Meanwhile, a section of residents of the area and district-level officials resented the non-inclination of the Tourism Department to tap the potential to develop water sports activities at Pulicat, as it had done at Mudaliyarkuppam in Kancheepuram district, located around 90 km from Chennai.At present, some fishermen are providing boating facility without safety measures in the backwaters and are charging hefty amounts. The visitors are taken for boating without even life jackets.The sources said they felt amused to note that the Tourism Department was contemplating to introduce a 32-seater luxury cruiser at Mudaliyarkuppam, a place which attracts weekend revellers only during lean and peak seasons in view of its location, while no effort was made to tap the tourism potential of Pulicat, a thickly populated area 60 km from Chennai.Ironically, in one of the budget papers, the department has claimed that Pulicat is India's second largest brackish water lagoon having about 16 island villages and is much sought-after breeding ground for rare birds.However, the local people felt happy after their long-pending demand for a bridge across the backwaters, constructed at a cost of Rs.17.15 crore under the Tsunami Emergency Assistance Project, connecting Pulicat with Pulicat Light House Kuppam Island, was fulfilled last year.\",\n",

The forum accepted the complainant's claim of Rs. 1.20 lakh with interest for deficiency in service and mental harassment.The Bench also directed the airline to pay Rs. 15,000 for mental agony and harassment and Rs. 5,000 for litigation cost.

The recovery is painful and effects productivity.The mantra from every physician in the capital during summer is to keep the body hydrated at any cost. Drink clean water and avoid carbonated soft drinks that contain preservatives, sugars and have high calorific value. Apart from water, lemon juice, coconut water and butter milk are the other options to keep body hydrated.Public should also keep track of electrolytes. Sometimes a dip in potassium and sodium levels in the body during summer could lead to convulsions. Consuming lot of water is a safe way to avoid sun strokes, says former superintendent of Gandhi Hospital and general physician at Yashoda Hospitals, Dr. B.

The oil contains oxidants that could lead to neurological and sometimes cardio-related problems.

Only when the severity increases, patients start searching for a doctor for treatment.This easily preventable ailment hampers productivity because the patient has to stay indoors for at least three days to recover from the viral attack.Since most of the times, the ailment is viral in nature, there is no silver bullet' and the treatment is purely based on symptoms.Physicians caution that gastroenteritis in children is dangerous. Children lose water quickly due to diarrhoea and vomiting. They stop eating because of nausea and abdominal pain. It is common among children to give intravenous fluids in a hospital, says District Medical Officer, Ranga Reddy, Dr. Ch.

Kanoria, Senior Vice-President, FICCI, at a recently held meeting on International trade, WTO and India: could we conclude Doha talks by 2011?' in New Delhi.  PHOTO: KAMAL NARANGThese are not the best of times for the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations under the aegis of the World Trade Organization (WTO).The talks, which began in November 2001, are nowhere near completion. What is worse the topic appears to have been dropped from public discourse. One hardly hears anything that would induce optimism on concluding the talks.While there could be many reasons for this justified public apathy, it is incorrect to write off the Doha development round. There are several reasons why the public at large have lost interest in the trade talks.The Doha Round, as would befit any other trade talks, is about highly technical issues. Even if there was some general interest, it soon became clear that the talks are all about resolving complex issues which are invariably couched in technical language.Trade talks are nothing if they have no jargon. It is too much to expect an average person to be interested in the arcanum of trade negotiations, which incidentally have never been abandoned. But for all practical purposes they remain inaccessible except to those who have a reason to be connected.To give just one example of what is going on now (according to a recent WTO press release): Delegations reiterated the particular issues that concern them: agriculture, non-agriculture market access, services, the balance of ambition between the three, special treatment for developing countries and smaller countries, cotton and fisheries subsidies and so on.''If that is relatively easy to follow, consider this (from the same press release)He (WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy) identified one issue as the biggest stumbling block at this stage: NAMA sectorals. This is about proposals for major trading economies  including emerging economies  to allow duty free or lower than normal duty on imports in particular sectors within the NAMA negotiations.Make it more accessibleRemaining inaccessible to a majority, the trade negotiators' good work has remained largely unappreciated. It is true that politicians give the trade talks the much needed visibility.However, as a rule they view the ongoing developments from the prism of their national and political interests. So even if momentarily the summits of political leaders manage to elicit some interest, they are soon forgotten.Repeated failure to meet deadlines has induced a dose of scepticism, if not outright cynicism, on the final outcome. That is another reason why the average person is switched off from the talks.One basic point about the trade talks is that political leaders who try to muster the political support back home face a piquant situation. Successful trade talks involve striking a balance between give and take.In the very nature of things, the advantages of trade agreements are to be seen over the medium-term. Not many who are leading the trade discussions in nearly all the countries would be around to see the benefits. However, once a trade pact is concluded, politicians will have to face the wrath of lobbyists, trade groups and others whose immediate interests would seem to be compromised by, say, an agreed tariff loweringChampioning the causeOne of the consistent supporters of multilateral trade as embodied by the Doha Round is Jagdish Bhagwati, eminent trade economist and professor at Columbia University.Recently in Delhi, he warned against the consequences of a failure to conclude the Doha Round. It would spell doom for developed and developing countries, he said.A series of bilateral trade deals would dominate global trade, giving more authority to richer countries, resulting in discrimination and perpetuating distortions.Failure to conclude the Doha Round would result in a situation where weaker nations will not prosper and hegemonic powers like the Americans and the Europeans would establish trade deals with smaller powers and dominate world trade in their own way, which is not possible in a multilateral system.If the trade talks collapse, there would be a number of other deleterious consequences as well. The WTO's role will be considerably diminished.That would be unfortunate for the global economy. It was expected that a successful multilateral trade round would provide a debt-free stimulus to countries, an advantage that is of great relevance in the recovery phase of the global economy.If WTO's powers are diminished, the incalculable value of its disputes settlement authority would be severely impaired. Through this authority the WTO has brought the rule of law to world trade. The smallest of countries can bring to account the richest country, forcing the latter to stop trade distortions.The G-20 countries, which initially stressed collective action as a means of overcoming the recession, have become less enthusiastic in seeking a closure of the Doha Round. For the record, at the Seoul Summit (November 2010), it was decided to seek a closure by the end of this year.Much has always depended on the U.S. and the EU. In mid-2008 the talks which showed some rare promise of leading to a breakthrough floundered at the last minute. The rich countries blamed India but it was the U.S.' refusal to reduce agricultural subsidies further and India's refusal to ask its subsistence farmers to compete with subsidised American farmers that were the principal causes.The outside environment has changed considerably since then. Sky-high global food prices dramatically alter the assumptions behind the American farm subsidies.While that could help in softening the U.S. stand on what has been an intractable issue, the political climate in rich countries is less conducive to trade deals than it was before.C.

Individuals from different parts of the country are collecting and collating up-to-the-minute information using the social media, especially Twitter.This story began with a couple of tweets and discussions on midnight power cuts and unplanned interruptions, and Ajay Kumar, a software engineer and NGO worker, created http://powercuts.in/early May. Reports started pouring in, mainly through Twitter. In the first 24 hours, the hash tag reached more than 98,000 people with over 1,57,000 impressions. Sorted into categories of 'planned,' unplanned,' good news' (indicating no power cuts) and voltage,' there are more than 15.55 reports the site receives in a day on an average.While moderators incorporate the updates from Twitter, information received through the smartphone applications updates the map automatically. Gurgaon was the first place where power cuts were mapped, says Mr. Kumar, but the moment of pride was when people of the villages of Jharkhand and Jammu responded.People volunteer for data crunching and technical help through an open Google document. Suggestions include pitting this data against diesel prices and farm output and comparing the billed units with the consumed units to figure out how much electricity is being stolen.This is the latest instance of crowd-sourcing  getting a group of people to provide data on a particular subject. Internet analyst Clay Shirky refers to cognitive surplus  the shared, online work done with spare brain cycles. While people are busy editing Wikipedia, by posting to Ushahidi they are building a better, more co-operative world, he says.Infrastructure issues are taken for granted in our country. This initiative will prompt people to think about the excessive money spent on imported invertors, and wake [them] up to what others are facing, says Nikhil Pahwa, editor and publisher, Medianama, who is supporting the initiative.The Ushahidi platform, which provides free software for information collection, was first used to map reports of post-election violence in Kenya in 2008. The platform works well for information with a spatial component, but users like Mr. Kumar are aware of limitations. The website's original purpose leads to it's collating all information. We are trying to customise the data display for the last few hours or so.A similar mapping exercise, Mobile Telco #Fail, maps mobile network problems in India, while the recently launched spamcaller.in seeks to collect reports of spam of all sorts, including lottery scams, outdated offers and false mobile connections.The tricky part is sustaining participation, says Mr. Kumar. Only a few users provide reports, and there is a dearth of committed moderators and technical help. And it is possible only if people have access to twitter when there is a power cut.Another crowd-sourcing initiative on Ushahidi, the Bangalore security map http://bsm.mod.org.in/ was launched this week. It seeks to understand how citizens perceive security in the city by asking questions about their insecurities and pins responses on a map. This joint project of the Centre for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP) and MOD, an international collective of architects, designers, researchers, curators and practitioners based in Bangalore and Berlin, has 18 reports now.Behaviours of people and poorly handled infrastructure issues comprise most of the reports, says Jayanth R., researcher, CSTEP.The sample space in such cases can be non-representative. The many reports from South India may just mean more people are reporting, says Mr. Kumar. Getting people to collect information using the platform and to analyse the data is an intensive process. Data is crucial to sound policymaking, says Mr. Jayanth.These reports, by themselves, are not indicative of anything; they need to be collated with more sensible data to make sense, Mr. Kumar says.\",\n",

A few cases have also been booked, he said. Similar action was required in other parts of the State to completely curb the illegal activity, he said.He said the KMF had submitted a proposal to the State Government to increase the incentive given to milk producers to Rs. 4 per litre for buffalo milk to match the prices offered by milk cooperative societies in the neighbouring States.Price factorMr. Reddy said farmers producing buffalo milk preferred to sell it to milk cooperative societies in neighbouring States rather than the KMF due to the price factor.At present, the State Government, besides the regular price offered by the KMF, was providing an incentive of Rs. 2 for every litre of milk supplied to the federation.According to a study, Mr. Reddy said about five lakh litres of milk from Bidar district alone was transported to neighbouring Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh due to the better prices there.Need for controlIf we could provide attractive prices to the milk producing farmers in Bidar region, the milk which is sold across the border can be effectively controlled and the capacity of the KMF dairy run by the Gulbarga-Bidar Milk Producers Union in Gulbarga would increase automatically, he said. Modernisation and expansion of the Gulbarga dairy would be taken up once the procurement of milk reached three lakh litres a day from the present 55,000 litre a day.

They secured prices ranging anywhere between Rs. 4,000 to Rs. 6,000 a quintal against the minimum support price of Rs. 3,000. Increase in the input costs and other overheads like inter-cultivation and harvesting charges were well taken care of by the good price.According to the Agriculture Department authorities, cotton crop, mostly Bt-cotton, was cultivated in about 17.39 lakh hectares in 2010-11 and there was 37.92 lakh tonnes of production.Crop loss in countries like China and Pakistan and worldwide increase in the demand for cotton have helped farmers get the best ever price this year, an official said.But, their worry is that there could be a repeat of the countrywide shortage of pulses recorded a few years ago and have political ramifications.Area of cultivationCotton was cultivated over an extent of just 14.74 lakh ha in 2009-10 and the good rains had added to the higher coverage of the crop.Similarly, pulses were cultivated in 10.52 lakh ha in 2010-11 with a production of 16.17 lakh tonnes and it was just 7.6 lakh ha and 14.32 lakh tonnes in 2009-10.On the other hand, the farming community is also concerned over a likely hike in Bt-cotton seed prices as Union Minister for Agriculture Sharad Pawar was learnt to have written to Chief Minister N.

It has the lowest voter presence of 1,66,077, including 85,486 men and 80,591 women, in Cuddalore district.Yet, the Neyveli Township has a considerable chunk of electorate, numbering about 55,000 to 58,000, almost one-third of the total electorate in the segment. Obviously, the preference of the residents of the Neyveli Township, termed as a mini-Bharat because of its multi-ethnic and multi-lingual population, would be the deciding factor in the outcome of the elections.Neyveli Township has become the hub of activity as it provides employment to 14,000 regular staff and 13,000 contract workers in its open cast mines and thermal power stations.The trade union activism is quite pronounced here and land providers too have become a force to reckon with because of their assertive nature, of late. The socio-economic development of peripheral areas, therefore, is directly linked to the performance of the NLC, which has embarked on an ambitious expansion mode across the country.Hence, the residents of the Neyveli Township and its environs value industrial peace more than anything else. However, when it comes to protection of public sector enterprise status of NLC, the trade unions, political parties and local community stand united.However, the contentious issue that has been dogging the NLC management has been the size of compensation and nature of jobs to be given to land providers, particularly when it needs vast tract of land for augmenting lignite production and power generation to meet the insatiable demand.The trade unions and political parties whip up this issue time and again to the disenchantment of the NLC management. The PMK and its trade union wing, Pattali Thozhir Sangam (PTS), have come to the fore in upholding the rights of the employees and land providers.PMK candidate T. Velmurugan (sitting Panruti MLA) had spearheaded many agitations, raised the issues in the Assembly and also succeeded to some extent in obtaining compensation. He is now backed by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and its trade union Labour Progressive Front (LPF).Incidentally, the LPF and the PTS are the only two recognised unions that can sit across the table with the NLC management representatives to thrash out the labour issues. It is the view of the local community that they would favour a candidate, who would impress upon the government and the management the need to get things done, without harming industrial relations, and also pave the way for overall development of the region.',\n",

       " '58dc9366a3d24b426016693e': \": Where will Chennai figure if its public transport bus system is compared with other large metropolitan cities? The sad truth is: somewhere at the bottom of the pile. The Metropolitan Transport Corporation's (MTC) operational fleet of 3,000 buses is one of the lowest among any major metropolis in the country. The comparison with Delhi's fleet of 8,000 or Bangalore's 6,100 buses is even more telling because both the cities transport fewer passengers every day than Chennai.Most major city bus services in the country account for a ridership of 40 to 50 lakh passengers a day. The MTC carries 56 lakh passengers a day with less than half the number of buses as other cities. Overcrowding during rush hour is rampant.Since its days of glory in the 1980s when the then Pallavan Transport Corporation was considered one of the best in the country, public transport in the city has taken a major hit due to persistent neglect, say experts. One attempt to reverse this trend in favour of public transport is the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) proposal which is under the consideration of the government. The move is long overdue. Surveys to build dedicated bus lanes were undertaken in 1967, 1975 and as recently as 2009. Every time, private vehicle traffic was given preference and diverting a lane exclusively for buses was found unfeasible. This, despite the fact that MTC buses transport over 50 per cent of the passenger volumes on major arterial roads.There is an element of social equity involved when deciding who gets to use the city's road space, says Shreya Gadepalli of the Ahmedabad-based Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP). MTC buses plying through both Anna Salai and Grand Southern Trunk Road have a carrying capacity of about 11,000 passengers per hour per directional (pphpd), which, interestingly, is almost the same as a monorail corridor. The BRT being proposed on Rajiv Gandhi Salai will have a capacity of 14,000 pphpd, says Ms.Gadepalli.Buses can shuttle through the proposed corridor at 25-30 kmph, instead of the current average speed of 6 kmph.The amount of overcrowding and delay due to congestion will soon become too much to even sustain bus operation in Chennai, says Sudhir Badami, an urban transportation expert and a member of the Mumbai BRTS technical advisory committee.Studies show that bus passengers get exhausted by the amount of crowding as well as side sways and lateral forces even for a 2-3 km journey. Why should the majority of people suffer just because a few people can go in cars? It is the duty of the government to ensure equitable living standards and a respectable, dignified life for everyone, Mr.Badami adds.Insisting that no amount of road building can accommodate the vehicle growth rate that the city is going through, R.Balasubramanian, a former Managing Director of MTC, said Proposals for a dedicated bus corridor on OMR were made way back in 2006. But we never do things until it has become too late. Our city planners have largely failed to provide residents a better quality of life.\",\n",

After playing a documentary film, they provided details about the nine sites where gurdwaras were razed.They also pointed out that attempts were made to construct temples at some places, while idols and pictures of Hindu gods put up at others. At one such site, signs of Swastika were also painted. Most sites were now marked by dilapidated boundary walls, debris of burnt bricks and remains of some structures.At many places, non-Sikh residents favoured reconstruction of the gurdwaras and restoration of normality.Mr. Peermohammad chided the mainline Sikh leadership in the various factions of the Akali Dal, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) and the religious sects that organised Kar Sewa at large shrines for ignoring these small gurdwaras, which served the poor sections of the community.He said that recently the DSGMC announced its decision to spend Rs. 57 crore on the renovation of the historic shrine Rakab Ganj, which according to him already was full of grandeur.He said that the Kar Sewa sects were busy putting marble and gold-plated domes on the shrines where the managements were already flush with resources.Shrines ignoredMr. Navkiran pointed out that these shrines were also ignored when the Prime Minister's special package was announced in 2006 after the Nanavati Commission came out with the report for rehabilitating the November 1984 victims.The Centre, SGPC, DSGMC and the Sikh sangat must be involved in restoring the shrines.It is not necessary that a shrine be reconstructed. At the vacant sites, let them put up a library, charitable hospital or anything that can be of common social use. But the memory of those who were killed on those spots should be maintained, he said.While these organisations would create public opinion, they would seek more information about similar sites in Delhi and other parts of the country that witnessed riots.They would also write to the Union government and related authorities to ensure justice to these shrines as well, the leaders said.\",\n",

As Chenchus resisted the attempt, complaints were lodged against them at Kothapalli police station in Kurnool district and Kollapur in Mahabubnagar district.Kurnool police refused to intervene in the matter saying larger issues were involved in the matter, while Kollapaur police asked Chenchus to stay away from the fishing for the next four years honouring the auction system in which traditional fishermen had bought the right. The gram panchayat at Sivapuram asked Chenchus to withdraw from fishing.Out of 75 Chenchu families living at Sivapuram, only 22 were engaged in the fishing activity at Ragimanupenta, Gangamma Konda, Chenchu Konda and Lingamayyapenta, all Chenchu hamlets. However, the problem surfaced because the traditional fishermen, who used large nylon nets and mechanised boats, identified the zones under the control of Chenchus as the potential fishing areas.Due to less disturbance and low human activity, more fish reached the places. As fishing reached the commercial proportion, friction has been taking place between the two groups. Chenchus have never been organised into the trade and no societies were formed.As the pressure mounted, a delegation of Chenchus met Joint Collector Jyothi M. Buddha Prakash seeking recognition of their right under the Scheduled Tribes and other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recogntion) Act, 2006. Mr. Buddha Prakash too agreed to the view that the fishing right could be considered under the Act and referred the matter to Revenue Divisional Officer, who heads the panel for rights recognition.Aireni Krishna, a Chenchu activist of Sivapuram, lamented that though no formal case was registered against them, he was frequently summoned to the police station pressuring to settle the matter with the fishermen.He said though higher officials were sympathetic towards them, the lower level field officers were ignorant of the powerful law in their favour. The Fisheries Department, which granted licences, ignored completely the presence of Chenchus.According to the ITDA records, 198 Chenchu families were engaged in the fishing activity.',\n",

Provoked by the BJP, Dalits also held a demonstration at Tijara sub-division earlier this week.Even as four of the Dalit families have since returned to Husaipur, local BJP leaders have charged State Medical and Health Minister Aimaduddin Ahmed Khan  elected to the Assembly from Tijara constituency in which Husaipur falls  with shielding the accused. A Meo youth, Zahid, had died in the firing by Dalits.Meos allegedly launched a daylight attack on Dalits belonging to the poor Meghwal community on January 19 following the firing incident and drove them out of the village, 10 km from the famous Bhiwadi industrial area. The dispute started when a hen reared by a Dalit family was crushed under the wheels of Zahid's tractor.While police arrested five Dalit youths on charges of Zahid's murder, those who burnt Dalits' houses and looted their belongings including cash and jewellery were at large for a fortnight. Five of them were arrested over the weekend following pressure exerted by Dalit activists here in Jaipur. Those arrested include Zahid's two brothers and a cousin.The Government has sanctioned financial assistance of Rs.25,000 each to 16 Dalit families as an interim measure and distributed the aid to 13. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, makes it mandatory for the administration to provide immediate assistance to the victims of caste violence.Amid reports of deliberate delay in Dalits' rehabilitation, an eight-member delegation comprising civil rights activists from Jaipur visited Husaipur on Friday and met both sides to broker peace. M. I. Siddiqui of Jamat-e-Islami Hind, a member of the delegation, told The Hindu here that tension in the village was receding and the two sides had agreed not to fall prey to outsiders provoking them. We emphasised the need to evolve trust between Dalits and Muslims, who are victims of machinations by higher castes, and asked them to help out each other.Centre for Dalit Rights (CDR) patron P. L. Mimroth said the delegation asked the Dalit victims to rebuild their houses by utilising the government assistance and carry home their household goods left in the open after the BJP leaders advised them to display their losses in an exaggerated manner to claim high compensation.The delegation also met Alwar Collector Ashutosh Pednekar and Superintendent of Police Mahesh Goyal and requested them to ensure arrest of the real culprits. Mr. Mimroth said the two officers assured the delegation that the law would be strictly complied with.Health Minister Mr. Khan, who is scheduled to visit Husaipur on Sunday, faced some tough moments at Circuit House in Alwar on Friday when a group of Dalits raised slogans against him.The Dalits were annoyed by his previous visit to Husaipur a day after the violence and attending Zahid's burial, but not visiting the Dalit locality.Besides Mr. Siddiqui and Mr. Mimroth, other members of the delegation were Navin Narain of ActionAid, Gopal Ram Verma of CDR, Paikar Farooq of Association for Protection of Civil Rights, Mohammed Salim of Jamat-e-Islami Hind, Suman Devathia of Dalit Mahila Manch and Maualna Haneef of the People's Union for Civil Liberties.\",\n",

Balachary, UNICEF district coordinator, small steps that would be implemented at the early stage of pregnancy and proper care for the new born babies would arrest these deaths.Pilot projectThe project would be implemented on a pilot basis in the district in 20 mandals.AnganwadisThe anganwadis would be entrusted with the job of identifying the pregnant women and passing on the information to the doctors at the primary health centres (PHCs). Same will be the case with new born babies.We are planning to implement the programme shortly. However, the required infrastructure needs to be established before that, which needs coordination between two to three departments, he said.\",\n",

Sixteen works on the rain-hit roads will be taken up.A detailed project report on executing works under an immediate water supply scheme at an estimated coast of Rs.7.7 crore was sought. The Tuticorin Port Trust extended funds of Rs.1 crore for laying a main road at Chidambaram Nagar under social economic activities. A desilting machine for underground drainage system would be procured at Rs.6 lakh.Modern sand sweeping machine would be purchased at a cost of Rs.20 lakh to clear heaps of sand deposited on roadsides. While presiding, Mayor R. Kasthuri Thangam gave nod for all works. Approval for the third phase of the Buckle canal for 1.1 km at an estimated coast of Rs.4.3 lakh was also given. The councillors hailed the initiative of the corporation when subjects were placed before them for proposal.Meanwhile, R. Veerabahu, AIADMK councillor of ward 27, said the residents attached to the ward could not get drinking water regularly. Since the first main pipeline suffered damage, the supply was stopped for carrying out maintenance works. Supply was affected just for a short period but it resumed after completing the repair works, the Mayor replied.But Mr. Veerabahu claimed that the people could get water once in five days a week. The Mayor denied his claims.Easwaran, AIADMK councillor of ward 32, alleged that exorbitant fee was collected at the gasifier crematorium. More than Rs.1, 350 was being charged for cremate a body. While crematoriums of similar kind in Madurai and Coimbatore charge only Rs.750 to Rs.800, how could Tuticorin Corporation charge this much, he asked. The meeting was attended by Dinesh Ponraj Oliver, Commissioner, S.A. Rajagopalan, Executive Engineer, and other officials.',\n",
       " '58dc97a3a3d24b4260166bf0': \"Sabarimala tragedyAs an ardent pilgrim who has been visiting the Sabarimala shrine for 25 years, I can say that a stampede of the sort that occurred on January 14  claiming 102 lives  can take place at any point of time anywhere on the hill. The main reason is that the authorities cannot judge the crowd pouring in on a particular day. Moreover, Pulmedu  where the tragedy struck  is a forest route which very few know of and which has very poor infrastructure.The Devaswom Board, with the help of local Ayyappa Seva Sangams, can introduce a registration procedure for the pilgrims. The group leader or Guruswamy can take the responsibility of registering his team. The date on which the group will reach the shrine and through what route can thus be tracked. Through better planning and organisation, stampedes can be prevented in future.K.L. Gangadharan,ChennaiEach Sabarimala pilgrimage season brings crores of rupees to the Kerala government. The least a pilgrim would expect are basic amenities and safety arrangements. That only four policemen were present at Pulmedu where the stampede occurred is unbelievable.Shambhu Soman,KollamThat there is a phenomenal growth in the number of devotees visiting Sabarimala during the Makarajyothi every year is well known. The Kerala government has the foremost responsibility of anticipating the numbers and making arrangements to meet any eventuality. No doubt, the hill terrain is difficult for crowd management. But precautionary measures would have surely prevented the major accident on Friday.On their part, devotees should be patient in mass assembling centres. It appears that immediately after the darshan of the celestial light at Ponnabalamedu, thousands of devotees hurried down the hill and passed through the congested pathway. The haste with which they moved might have caused the tragedy, with the geographical constraints adding to it.Sasidharan Uppath,PalakkadGovernments do not seem adequately prepared to deal with the consequences of massive crowding. Clearly, a good deal of mismanagement must have been involved in the latest tragedy at Sabarimala. Given the sheer number of devotees every year, the Kerala government should have illuminated the forest path through the Idukki district which is usually taken by pilgrims returning from the shrine.K.S. Jayatheertha,BangaloreThis is not the first time that a stampede has taken place in Sabarimala. Similar tragedies have taken place in the past, including in 1999. Unfortunately, we are none the wiser. The authorities seem to have reached a dead end in finding a lasting solution.I attribute the failure to the acts of omission on the part of the government. Caution is thrown to the winds and accidents continue unabated. While it is true there is no armour against fate, disasters can be avoided if prevention is made a top priority.K.G. Koru Kuttan Nair,MalaysiaMedia reports clearly show that we have not learnt any lessons from the past. It was not merely the dense forest or the lack of illumination that led to the tragedy, though it might have played a part. The basic reason is the reluctance on the part of the police to tackle the huge task in all earnestness. The fact that four constables were posted to look after thousands of devotees on their return journey is an indication of the casual attitude of those in charge of security. Had there been a Minister among the pilgrims, hundreds of policemen would have been in attendance to ensure his safety.I say this on the basis of my own experience with the police in Andhra Pradesh. I retired as a Depot Manager in APSRTC after 33 years of service. Wherever a big jathra operation was conducted, we had to beg the police to post adequate police but very few personnel were allotted for the task. The police are unwilling to work on queue. They prefer to get posted near the temple entry point or near the commercial stalls erected for the jathra. Those tasked with managing the crowd are reluctant. It is not hi-fi technology or huge manpower that is needed to avoid such tragedies. The will to work and application will do.B.M. Sastry,HyderabadA reader suggests that the pilgrimage season to Sabarimala be extended beyond the existing two months (Letters, Jan. 17). In fact, keeping the temple open for as many as 10 months will help mitigate the rush during the Mandalam' and Maharam.' It can remain closed for two months a year  a month after every five months. The temple can also remain closed for a few days after the 'Mandalam' darshan. This will give the devotees more options to plan their annual pilgrimage. The most orthodox may object to this but for practical reasons, some flexibility is certainly called for.I.S. Kanthimathinathan,TirunelveliOn demolitionThe order of the Ministry of Environment and Forests to demolish the controversial Adarsh Cooperative Housing Society building in Mumbai citing lack of authorisation and clearance (Jan. 17) is surprising. It does not take into account the lapses on the part of several agencies. Protecting the structure and using it in such a way that the public interest does not suffer would be a more rational and practical thing to do.M.G. Warrier,ThiruvananthapuramA 31-storey building could not have been constructed  in violation of various laws  without the help of many powerful people. Since the construction is over, the best option for the Centre is to take over the housing complex and utilise it for some constructive purpose. There is nothing, other than a piece of land, to be gained by demolishing the building.J.P. Reddy,NalgondaWas the cost of constructing the building taken into account before ordering the demolition? The dubious allotments in the building should be cancelled and the apartments reallocated to Kargil war widows.Tabita Gone,SecunderabadThe order will deal a blow to the families of the jawans killed in Kargil, in whose name the building was constructed. Crores of rupees of public money will be lost and the hopes of the families which stand to benefit under the original intent of the housing society will be dashed. Only a court can give an acceptable solution to the problem.P. Karthik Reddy,Ranga ReddyWhile the decision to demolish the Adarsh building speaks to the UPA government's willingness to act against the misuse of power by vested interests, it would be extremely impractical to implement it. Let us not end up wasting money, and losing a piece of property.Mohammad Imtiyaj Khan,MysoreThe demolition will serve as a deterrent to politicians, bureaucrats and service personnel trying to exploit the cause of Kargil war widows. But the long legal process will ensure that the demolition is never carried out and the building will stand as an insult to the war widows.N. Mohan,ChennaiIt is sad that the building has to be demolished but this is the right time to show that the rules will be followed even if it means incurring a loss. It will help society curb practices that originate from the knowledge that rules can be violated without inviting punitive measures. The law should be ruthless and the situation will, hopefully, correct itself.N. Ramani,ChennaiJallikattuThis refers to the report that one person was killed and 68 persons were injured at Palamedu near Madurai in the jallikattu event held on Sunday. The incident underlines the urgent need to ban the barbaric sport.The cruelty inflicted on the animals forced to take part in jallikattu  and the terrorising of the bulls which are forced to escape from a bunch of tormentors  is something that should not be encouraged. The Tamil Nadu government continues to allow the sport under the watchful eyes of the District Collector and a large posse of policemen, putting up special double barricades and keeping ambulances and doctors in attendance. Yet we find people getting injured. Is this the way to utilise our scarce resources?S. Chinny Krishna,ChennaiInstigate an animal to go wild and then try to control it  is this valour? It is depravity of the mind. What does a man get by endangering both himself and the animal? It is time we banned the dangerous sport. Inflicting injuries, and going wild and violent can never be part of a sport.R. Ramanathan,Coimbatore\",\n",

SUBRAHMANYAMChairperson of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) P. Shanta Sinha has called upon youth to engage with the system and strive to achieve the rights of the deprived sections instead of branding the system corrupt' and taking to violence.Participating as chief guest at the inaugural of a three-day national seminar on Containing violence: measures for resolution at GITAM University here on Saturday, she said the strength of dialogue and discussion could be understood only when conflict was identified. There was no use branding the officials as corrupt and doing nothing.Ms. Sinha said that nowhere in the world had violence resolved any issue. Those indulging in armed struggles against the system should realise that once they leave, the local people would be ruined and there would be total devastation of their culture, ethos and economy. Those championing the cause of deprived sections should convince the local administration and ensure that the Government schemes reach the former. She felt that the foundation of a non-violent movement was tougher than violence.Referring to the extreme forms of violence in Chattisgarh, Jharkhand and Bihar and violence due to displacement of tribals in Meghalaya, Tripura and Assam, she attributed hatred as the main cause of violence.She said that the local cadres could connect with the poorest of the poor, have the ability to take risks and want to change the system for the benefit of the poor tribals. Their only fault was that they were seeing violence as the only means to achieve it.Citing examples from the work being undertaken by NCPCR, she said how a young teacher had reformed a landlord who was against the education of children who were working as bonded labourers.Presiding over the meeting, Chairman of Indian Council of Philosophical Research Koneru Ramakrishna Rao who was recently selected for the Padma Sri award, spoke about the different forms of violence and the need to channel it in the right direction.He said that frustration, anger, sense of insecurity and perceived threat were triggering violence. He felt that violence could be conquered by conscientious practice of love and compassion.Max Velmans, a Professor of Psychology in Goldsmiths, University of London, spoke on the importance of family values and meeting the needs of people to prevent frustration and contain violence.

       " '58dc993ca3d24b4260166cee': \"A breed apart from the rest of his contemporaries, Delhi-based designer Sunil Mehra has imparted a unique dimension to his fashion statement by focusing on spirituality and peace.Sunil, who has been in the fashion business for the past two decades, generally designs traditional wear. Even his Western outfits have a desi touch. I mostly create sherwanis and jawahar jackets and crisp kurtas and use Indian silk, khadi, cotton and linen. Sometimes I import high-end cashmere but that is only while creating Western wear. Since I am against animal slaughter, I don't design leather belts and accessories that have leather in them, says this menswear designer.Though Sunil keeps himself aloof from the film industry, he designed the dress for Bollywood and Tamil cinema actor R. Madhavan in the just-concluded Filmfare awards.As Madhavan is blessed with simple looks I prepared the tuxedo that jells with his personality. Since Filmfare function is attended by the who's who of tinsel town, I also gave the tuxedo a glamorous look. The tuxedo has been teamed up with a white pleated shirt and a black and white tie. Even if I make a Western outfit I add a touch of Indian element by having mor ka pankh from inside.It was Madhavan who first approached the designer who then sent his team to get the correct measurements. The dress has been exclusively made for the actor. If a designer is based in Mumbai, he gets most of his clientele from Bollywood. Since I am based in Delhi I have mostly politicians and industrialists as my clients.Striving to work for emancipation of traditional karigars, Sunil wants to improve their economic condition and give them a better work environment. Only if the kargiars get remuneration commensurate to their talent will we get the desired results. Also traditional designs on handloom can be kept alive. Because of low salaries, karigars are taking up different professions like driving auto-rickshaws. They are the base of our fashion industry. If we have to keep alive our traditional skills, it is high time our designers think of a package for karigars. We don't require government support because they play an important part in the money we earn. Our design fraternity needs to look into their aspirations and set up a body exclusively for them.For his part, Sunil voluntarily hiked salaries of his karigars who do hand embroidery. I have 70 karigars who are engaged in hand embroidery. After increasing their wage, they are creating beautiful works and their traditional skills are shinning.With the entry of international brands in the Indian market, competition has increased manifold for our design fraternity. But Sunil feels competitiveness is advantageous as it is producing better results. Thanks to competition, we are touching different kinds of levels. We have started working hard and at the end of the day customers are getting better and diverse range of products.A self-taught designer, Sunil is critical of the mushrooming of fashion institutes across the country. How many students passing out from institutes that charge astronomical fees get employment in the fashion business? Coming from middle class families, their parents are coughing up to Rs.15 lakh as fees. But the sad part is these money-minting institutes are providing only bookish knowledge and students after passing out are not prepared to work for three to four years for a store or known name. Like a rolling stone, they keep switching jobs. Sunil says only when budding designers work for an extended duration will they be able to learn about the quality of different fabric. They will learn whether to use soft or stiff fabric while creating a dress. And in the process realise that they need to work without bloated egos and they cannot become chief designers overnight.To provide a holistic environment to budding designers, Sunil is planning to set up a design institute, preferably in the National Capital Region. Students will learn everything relating to design in a congenial environment. In fact, I plan to teach them intricacies of fashion in the lap of nature like Rabindranath Tagore's ashram at Santiniketan. First, they will be taught how to be better human being, have right values and value lives of others. Only if they have beautiful thoughts will they be in a position to come up with innovative designs. I want them to portray a part of their personality into every dress. If you observe a painting created by M. F. Husain or Tagore, you can automatically make out that it is their creation.Seven years ago, the designer got so besotted with Lord Krishna that he started emblazoning Him and Radha on collections mostly worn by Indian clients. Unmindful of the fact that he might be ridiculed by his colleagues, he introduced a spiritual dimension to his works.I went to Vrindavan and the journey started from there. Even my store has the ambience of Vrindavan and I have personally painted Lord Krishna on the walls. For others this was a new concept but not for me. That is the way I live and want to convey the love between Krishna and Radha.Sunil's next collection Madhuriya will be launched in March. It will highlight Krishna's smile and the inimitable way in which he plays his bansuri. Ever since I have become His disciple, my work output and creativity have increased.\",\n",

PHOTO: M.A. SRIRAMUnion Minister of State for Textiles Panabaka Lakshmi on Friday said that need-based cost cutting technologies, research, training and extension support given by research institutions under Central Silk Board (CSB) had enhanced productivity and quality of silk despite the area under mulberry cultivation coming down due to urbanisation, industrialisation and other reasons.In the last three decades, silk production in India had steadily grown, outpacing countries such as Japan and the erstwhile USSR, which were once the world's leading silk producers. India is now the second largest producer of raw silk after China with a production of 19,690 tonnes in 2009-10, accounting for 15.5 per cent of global production, she said.Speaking after inaugurating a two-day national conference on Sericulture innovations: Before and beyond being held in commemoration of the golden jubilee of Mysore-based Central Sericultural Research and Training (CSRTI) here, the Minister complimented CSRTI for bringing in sea change in the sericulture system through its research, training and extension support to the industry.She said that CSRTI has given a shift from conventional breed to the most sought-after bivoltine hybrids and high-yielding varieties of mulberry plants. India had become the pioneer in tropical sericulture technology because of these efforts, the Minister said.India, Ms. Lakshmi said, is also credited with being the oldest country producing all five distinct varieties of silk  mulberry, tasar, oak tasar, eri and muga silks.At the same time, India is the largest consumer of silk with large imports of mulberry raw silk and silk fabrics from China.Ms. Lakshmi said that the Textile Ministry had allocated Rs. 661 crore for the 11th Five Year Plan to implement catalytic development programmes with assistance for host-plant cultivation to loom upgrading.She said that Vanya silk is Central Silk Board's another area of focus and eri silk mills have been established to produce large quantities of high-grade spun silk.The Minister and the other dignitaries released a special issue, Indian Silk, brought out by CSRTI on its golden jubilee, a souvenir, and several other research volumes.

G. Rajendiran, Secretary of the Tamil Nadu Milk Producers Welfare Association, which leads the agitation, talking to The Hindu, says that the producers, mainly villagers, have been asked not to waste the milk on roads and also refrain from tethering cattle on roads and streets to block traffic.We have asked them not to pour milk on roads, which pains our hearts. Despite our pleas, a few do this irresponsible act, he points out.Many incidents of wasting the milk took place in Salem on Friday and in other places in Dharmapuri, Namakkal, Karur and Madurai districts since the agitation began on February 7.The milk producers strongly deny the charges that they are forcing the cows and buffalos to starve so that the animals yield less milk.Salem Collector J. Chandrakumar has warned the milk producers that media reports claim that many in villages resort to the practice of not feeding the animals with concentrated cattle feed that boost animals' health.If the reports are true, then it is very disturbing and unfortunate. It will affect the very reproductive system of the animals and bring down immunity power too, he says.The Collector says that the inhuman practice may lead to reduced yield of milk at present but may cause a huge economic loss to farmers.Rajendran says that no farmer would resort to such acts.We will never make the animals starve. Instead a few might resort to the practice of feeding the animals with less quantity of concentrated cattle feed - say from three kilograms to two kilograms. It is true that milk yield would come down. But with the steep cost escalation of fodder, to bring down which is one of their demands, the farmers have already put their animals on food rations, he points out.The agitation, demanding Rs. 5 for per litre for cow milk and Rs. 8 for buffalo milk, has intensified especially in the districts of Western Zone, a major supplier of milk to the State, and in many pockets in Madurai, Trichy and Perambalur districts affecting the supply to Aavin unions.Aavin Co-operative unions have started recording a mere 40 per cent of receipts forcing the government to adopt arm-twisting tactics' such as intimidating the suppliers to private dairy units, says another office bearer.Our Staff Reporter in Namakkal adds:In Namakkal, District Collector S. Madumathi appealed to farmers to refrain from starving their cattle in a bid to reduce the milk production.She noted that reducing the required healthy feed to gain petty financial benefits could be devastating in the long run.She pointed out that reduction of fodder disproportionate to the cow's body weight would not only reduce its milk-yielding capacity due to lack of required protein and fat content, but would also affect its ability to bear young ones, increase in gap between bearing calves and yielding poor disease-resistant calves.On Friday, Primary Cooperative Milk Collection Units in this district received 28,193 litres of milk (49 percent), which was a steady increase from a mere 22,259 litres (38 percent) on Thursday morning.However nearly 12,200 litres of milk was bought from private companies to take the total milk collection on Friday morning to 40,393 litres (70 percent), the highest since the strike began.Aavin sources said that milk collection is on the rise at all the five milk collection zones in the district  Rasipuram, Namakkal, Velur, Tiruchengode and Valapadi.We will constantly strive hard to convince farmers not to waste milk by pouring and to increase the collection, they added.Milk producers of Jaderpalayam near Paramathi Velur resorted to a demonstration on Thursday by distributing nearly 100 litres of milk free of cost to the financially backward local people on Thursday.We don't want to waste the milk and thought of making it useful to the deprived lot, they said.President of the Tamil Nadu Milk Producers Association K. Mohammed Ali who was here on Thursday countered the claim made by Minister for Milk and Dairy Development U. Mathivanan in the State Assembly on Wednesday that Tamil Nadu has fixed the highest milk procurement price in the country.In fact the procurement rate in other States ranges between Rs. 18 (Kerala) and Rs. 30 (Haryana), he added.While welcoming the Minister's assurance of calling us for talks after discussing the issue with Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, he made it clear that the strike would continue till all their three demands - increasing price of cow and buffalo milk by Rs. 5 and Rs. 8 per litre, regularizing the jobs of all PMCC staff and subsidy of Rs. 3 per litre milk - were met.Aavin milk production percentage in the district since Monday compared to the regular yield of 57,600 litres in the morning and 42,500 litres in the evening: Monday 57 (morning), 46 (evening); Tuesday 51, 45; Wednesday 51, 36; Thursday 38, 48; Friday 49.\",\n",

       " '58dc9ab6a3d24b4260166dbc': 'India has a staggering burden of chronic disease arising from a variety of causes, but there is encouraging evidence to show that it can reduce both death and disability through effective low-cost measures. The key to successful intervention lies in learning from good pilot programmes and making them integral to health-care protocols in both public and private sector institutions. A new series of articles published by The Lancet on universalising health coverage in India highlights the challenge that lies ahead. In the next two decades, chronic diseases resulting from cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, respiratory conditions, mental illness, and cancer are expected to cast a long shadow over national ambitions for economic growth in terms of healthy life-years lost. The section of the population that is likely to suffer the most will be those over 45. They may find the threat of infectious and parasitic diseases reducing with better standards of living but the threat of chronic diseases will increase. This is because the incidence of hypertension, poor control of blood glucose, tobacco use, and abuse of alcohol is expected to rise. The imperative therefore is to scale up the pilot programmes that have shown good results at prevention.Last year the central government approved two key measures  the testing of adults for chronic diseases, and an awareness campaign on healthy behaviour  as part of an integrated national programme for prevention and control of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes. A lot more needs to be done structurally to align policies with disease reduction goals. Regulation of unhealthy foods to reduce high calorie and salt content can mitigate the risk of diabetes and hypertension but this agenda is not making speed. Also, the unhealthy effects of energy-dense foods are compounded by negative changes in the urban environment. This experience shows that an assessment of the health effects of macroeconomic policies must be made mandatory. Achieving a drastic reduction in tobacco use must be made a national priority in the fight against cancer. The State health ministers, who met recently in Hyderabad, have done well to recognise the need to curb both smoking and smokeless forms of tobacco. But even with modified lifestyles, a medicalised approach to prevention will be needed. There are examples in this area to show that population-level testing for impaired blood glucose and hypertension, followed by a protocol of lifestyle modification and low-cost drug therapy, can stop disease progression. Given such clear evidence, the campaign against chronic disease must move into high gear.',\n",

The agency, which has become a tool at the hands of successive governments at the Centre, does nothing more than covering up the acts of ruling parties and harassing their opponents.Both during the investigation and while filing the closure report, the CBI mentioned Aarushi's father as a suspect. If there was any substance in the allegation, the CBI should have proved it. Otherwise, pointing a finger at him serves no purpose other than inflicting more pain on the grief-stricken parents. One can only hope that the premier investigating agency will analyse its failures and try to improve its functioning.Suresh Singh Katoch,DodaEven before the nation could get over the shocking news that rights activist Binayak Sen was sentenced to life by a Chhattisgarh court on the basis of questionable evidence comes the news that that the CBI has filed a closure report in the Aarushi-Hemraj murder case. A young girl, along with her domestic help, was murdered in her own house and the CBI could not crack the case.On the one hand, our criminal justice system awards a life sentence to a rights activist, probably to send a message to other Maoist sympathisers and, on the other, allows the killer of two to roam freely among us. If this is not travesty of justice, what is?Eswari Arun,TiruchiThe CBI's closure report is hardly surprising for those who know how the agency works. It is used by the ruling party to hound its opponents. It can be influenced, silenced and made to do the bidding of its political masters.

For this to happen, it should become a truly independent agency.M.V. Nahusharaj,BangaloreDown and downThe article A year of down and down for Congress (Dec. 31, 2010) was timely. It effectively brought out the highs and lows of the Congress in 2010. Whether it is on the inglorious Radia tapes expos or the Commonwealth Games imbroglio, the Congress is going to have a difficult time restoring the citizen's faith in the UPA government.S. Nazrin,KollamThe Congress-led UPA government has changed the definition of governance. UPA II showed us how corporate houses with the help of a lobbyist can subvert the system and appoint a person of their wish to a Ministry of their choice. The government must show some concern for the aam aadmi, if it wants to continue in power. The emergence of effective leaders like Nitish Kumar has sent a clear message  deliver or face the music.Dishank Purohit,JaipurOne of the notable aspects of the year gone by is the unprecedented rise in public cynicism towards the political class. An entire session of Parliament ended without transacting any business, with the Opposition demanding a JPC probe into the 2G spectrum allocation and the ruling dispensation not agreeing to it. The Radia tapes were an eye-opener to many as they showed how our democracy can be manipulated by corporates through their lobbyists.Bringing in more transparency and accountability and restoring people's faith in democracy should be the UPA government's priority in 2011.Shanila Jeyaram,MaduraiOur politicians have exploited the term democracy,' maimed it and manipulated it to serve their narrow interests. We swear by our democracy saying people are supreme and they have the power to change the government in the next election. But at the time of elections, we find that the same politicians win not by using democratic means but by twisting the system.The only hope of democracy lies in the freedom of speech.

He answered: Leave them, one day they will become good people.Today, Ta'if is one of the most beautiful places in Saudi Arabia. Aasia's persecution amounts to a misrepresentation of Islam.Syed Tahoor Tariq,GhaziabadIn this age of secularism, democracy and socialism, it is hard to believe that there are nations in which people are hunted down in the name of blasphemy.

Next, he was given what was called the mosquito oil, to be applied on his hands and face (after sunset, no one was allowed to wear half-sleeve shirts). If the area was prone to malaria, taking quinine tablets every evening during the roll call was a must. All unit commanders dreaded the number of malarial cases reported in a month.

For that is where the conmen relieved him of a staggering Rs. 10 lakh. Heartbreakingly, Mr. Thyagaraj's dealing was on his friend's behalf and he had raised the money from a private finance company in Mangalore.He came here on Thursday morning with money to buy gold for his friend's sister, who is getting married shortly, and believed he was buying gold far cheaper [than the market price], Deputy Superintendent of Police (Bangalore Rural) Kumara Swamy told The Hindu.The conmen targeted him at a wedding in Somawarapet in Madikeri district, baiting him with a story of gold ingots found on their land while ploughing, which they planned to sell at half the market rate.There were four men who told me to come to Bangalore with the cash.

The November-May pattern  already put in place by Mahatma Gandhi University  would at one stroke rationalise the way in which universities evaluate the answer scripts of the examinations of the credit and semester system.These were among the decisions taken at a meeting of Pro-Vice Chancellors of universities convened here by the Kerala State Higher Education Council (KSHEC).The annual, two-month vacation pattern militates against the spirit of the semester mode of the new degree courses. It is also inevitable for the University of Kerala for now because there are annual-mode courses with the traditional end-of-the-course March-April examinations in the university. The Kannur, Calicut and MG universities no longer have degree courses in the annual mode.The shift to a new holiday pattern would, however, involve amending the rules of individual universities governing vacations. The government would also need to amend the service rules of teachers. It was agreed at the PVCs meeting that the KSHEC would take up the matter with the government so that the latter can issue necessary directions of the Director of Collegiate Education.The meeting of the PVCs also decided to convene another meeting, this time including the Controllers of Examinations from all universities, to discuss the development of a standardised Grade Card for the sixth semester examinations. The Pro-Vice Chancellor of M.G. Unversity Rajan Varghese told The Hindu that existing differences in the grade cards issued by different universities would generate confusion when students seek admission to postgraduate courses, both in the State and outside.In all varsities save the University of Kerala, the first batch of students of the credit and semester degree programme would pass out in 2012. If such students are to find seamless admission to postgraduate programmes, the varsities would have to recalibrate such programmes too in the credit and semester mode.CurriculumIt was decided at the meeting that all universities would carry out such curriculum revisions so that the new courses can be offered in the academic year 2012-13. The Council would provide assistance to universities to conduct workshops for such curriculum changes.However, it is likely that the University of Kerala would take one more academic year to convert its PG courses into the credit and semester mode (its PG courses are already in the semester mode.). J. Prabhash, Pro-Vice Chancellor of the University of Kerala pointed out to The Hindu that the varsity introduced the new degree programme one year after the other universities did.The committee of PVCs which used to meet regularly  under the previous HEC  to review the roll-out of the new degree programmes met here last week after a gap of many months.',\n",

Photo: Thakur Ajay Pal SinghCotton growers of the district are a worried lot over the non-availability of market price for their hard-earned produce in spite of investing huge amount in cultivation of the crop while facing odd dry weather conditions and being on the verge of committing suicide unable to clear the debts.Already, cotton farmers have suffered with poor yield due to deficit rainfall and power cuts following the general strike.Traders have reportedly formed a syndicate' and have not been providing the market price to cotton growers forcing the farmers to resort to distress sale.Against the prevailing market price of Rs.4,500 per quintal, traders are purchasing cotton ranging from Rs.3,500 per quintal to Rs.3,900 per quintal. The Cotton Corporation of India entered into procurement as the minimum support price fixed by the government was Rs.3,300 per quintal.Farmers of Karimnagar district cultivated cotton in 2.35 lakh hectare against normal area of 1.73 lakh hectare. However, due to deficit rainfall, the crop almost withered in rain-fed regions of the district.In other regions where the ground water table was available, farmers could not protect their crops from withering due to power cuts following the general strike during the crucial month of September and October.Though some farmers had irrigation sources to protect their crops, but the lack of power supply caused withering of crops and resulted in poor yield. Farmers had expected a yield ranging from 10 to 15 quintals per acre, but could harvest only two to three quintals.A farmer of Gollapalli village in Bejjankin mandal said that he had invested Rs.20,000 per acre for cultivating cotton after purchasing seeds and fertilizers in the black market'. But, the yield was hardly three quintals and there was no market support price, he added. The government which had assured to pay Rs.10,000 per acre to farmers who had declared crop holiday should increase the MSP of cotton and bail out debt-ridden farmers in the region, he pointed out.Majority cotton farmers fear that the spate of suicides would increase due to pressures from money-lenders as they would not be able to clear debts with the available market price for their produce.\",\n",

So, it was the duty of the government to procure this salvaged paddy without making an issue of FAQ standards, he said.The OKS also demanded hike in procurement price of paddy. As per Mr Sadangi it should be hiked to at least Rs 1,500 per quintal.At present minimum procurement price of paddy was fixed at Rs 1,180 per quintal. The OKS leaders said hike in procurement price would be a great help for peasants of Ganjam district who had suffered crop loss during two consecutive kharif seasons.Untimely cyclonic rain in December 2010 had completely damaged standing crop. It was followed by low rainfall and drought in the area during current kharif season.Without fixing any target the government should procure total paddy produced by peasants in this drought-hit area, said OKS activists.If government machinery can show interest to bail out Kingfisher airlines then why can't same zeal be shown to provide succor to drought-hit farmers? asked Mr Sadangi.They also suggested to have paddy procurement at every panchayat level and to keep out private millers from the procurement process.They were critical of use of private millers in paddy procurement process with the allegation that it leads to corrupt practices.\",\n",

More than 1,250 out of the total 1,500 households have opened their savings bank accounts in the branch.Buoyed by the good response from the village to the programme, Andhra Bank Deputy General Manager V.M.

The bank is in for the second phase of the FI programme, facilitating credit facility to the account-holders, he added. The Andhra Bank has set up a help desk with its personnel for vetting all the documents relating to the applications seeking loans, paving the way for issue of sanction letters at the meeting instantly. The bank has appointed a Customer Service Provider (CSP) from the village who accepts debit and credit operations by the account holders with the help of a device, point of service terminal (POST). The customers can either withdraw or credit cash into their accounts electronically through the device which allows the transactions on insertion of Biometric cards into it. The customers can also view their balance position in their account by placing their thumb on the screen of the device. All such transactions will take place right at the doorstep of the customers.The initiative is expected to help banks tap the saving potential of the villagers. The village is mostly inhabited by agricultural workers. To quote the CSP, an army of 1,000 farm hands will go to far off places located 25 km away for work and each one works for 12 hours and earns Rs 1,000 a day on an average.

Ramasubramanian held that even those who had resigned could continue in the post until the new office-bearers were elected in terms of Section 19 of the Wakf Act, 1995.The Wakf Board is a body corporate under Section 13 (3) of the Act and hence it would have perpetual succession. The resignation of the Chairperson and a majority of the members of the Wakf Board may not really bring to an end, their continuity of office, the judge said.He made the observations after the Standing Counsel for the Wakf Board stated that the present petitioners' plea to extend their appointment (which expired in December last) as trustees of the Tiruchi Trust could not be considered until a full complement of the Wakf Board was duly constituted.Recording his submission, the judge said: The contention loses sight of one important legal aspect namely that no institution would tolerate vacuum. While the petitioners are concerned about the expiry of their term, the Wakf Board which is to take care of such contingencies itself is not functional as on date.Nevertheless, in view of his decision in terms of Section 19 of the Act, the judge directed the Chief Executive Officer of the Wakf Board to convene a meeting of the officers, who had resigned but continue to hold the office, within four weeks to take an appropriate decision on the petitioners' plea.If in the meantime the Government chooses to notify the appointment of a new set of members, those members shall take up the agenda relating to the extension of office of the petitioners and pass necessary resolution appointing a new set of trustees for the wakf in question, he added.\",\n",

Justice K. Chandru passed the ruling while dismissing a batch of writ petitions filed by those managing private vehicle stands at Virudhunagar, Srivilliputtur and Rajapalayam Municipalities. The petitioners included the Pennington Committee, a 130-year-old registered society based in Srivilliputtur.According to them, Section 270E of the Municipalities Act insists on obtaining licence only for a cart stand' and not for a bicycle or other two-wheeler stand.They also claimed that they were running the stands for many years and hence they could not be prevented all of a sudden without any justification. They termed the municipalities' insistence on obtaining licences as a violation of their right to carry on any trade or business under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.Rejecting all their contentions, the judge pointed out that an explanation appended to Section 270B (provision of public cart stands) stated that a cart-stand would, for the purposes of the Act, include stand for carriages including motor vehicles within the meaning of Indian Motor Vehicles Act and animals. Further Section 3 (5) of the Act defined carriage' as any wheeled vehicle with spring or other appliances acting as springs and includes any kind of bicycle, tricycle, rickshaw and palanquin, but does not include any motor vehicle within the meaning of the India Motor Vehicles Act, 1914.Section 3 (6) defined the term cart' as any wheeled vehicle which is not a carriage but does not include any motor vehicle within the meaning of the India Motor Vehicles Act, 1914. A combined reading of the provisions would prove that bicycle stands could not be run without obtaining a licence. Therefore, the right of a private cart stand operator depends upon the decision of a municipality and no fundamental right to carry on trade can be pleaded by private operators. No person was authorised to run a private vehicle stand without the permission of the municipal council, the judge added.\",\n",

Of the two, the state of NH 210 is worse.The stretch between Devipattinam and Devakottai on NH 210 has a number of deep cuts and pits at different locations. The asphalting on the stretch has disappeared at several points. The potholes, two to three-feet deep at vantage spots, render the road unsafe for vehicular movement. It is not just small vehicles facing trouble, the big vehicles including buses and lorries also labour a lot to pass through NH 210.Bad roads mean trouble for vehicles. The cars and trucks develop problems and motorists find themselves in the garage. Driving on rough roads is not only fuel consuming but increases the maintenance cost, says Karthick, a cab driver in Ramanathapuram.He adds that the vehicles driven during the nights develop snags quickly as drivers are unable to control the vehicles on seeing deep pits and potholes on these roads.Pointing out to the promise made by the authorities that the damaged roads will be relaid or restored temporarily, the road users say it is a promise still to be honoured.

Mr. Mendonsa told The Hindu that he once bought a beautiful handicraft priced at $ 300 (almost Rs. 15,000 then) and was shocked to see a similar piece sold in Bangalore for a mere Rs. 150. With so much talent, it is a wonder why they should sell it at a low price in India, he said.Middlemen and designers from Europe and the U.S. were talented enough to get handicraft items made of beads, shells, and glass at a very cheap price in India and sold them in the international market at a huge margin, he said. Many globally-renowned fashion designers used to fly down to Rajasthan (Jaipur), Tamil Nadu, and Kerala to learn art and handicraft.Silk, embroidery, and bead work on fabrics and leather were their areas of interest. These products had huge demand in the West. Creativity was an inborn gift for Indian women and they do wonders with their fingers. The products were superior in quality than those made using machines, he added.Mr. Mendonsa said that use of fingers stimulated the brain to be even more creative. Making handicrafts was a very low investment business that did not required an office or heavy and expensive machinery.Proper support and guidance from the government will help women here earn a lot of money, he said.The government should play a key role in helping handicraft makers by establishing quality testing units as small-scale handicraft makers cannot afford to set up such facilities.Born in India, Mr. Mendonsa has been a designer of fashionable accessories in the U.S. for more than two decades.

The memory of dates and years has faded in their minds, but what has not is the turn of events on the fateful day of November 27, 1973 and the misery that unfolded later.I remember the day this incident happened, there were many food poisoning cases in the paediatric ward. Children were lined up for treatment. Aruna volunteered to stay longer that day to help. Such was her integrity to work. She was very committed, Pramila Khushe, a nurse at King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital here and Aruna's senior, told The Hindu.I knew her since she was a student to the time she was promoted to be the staff nurse. We knew her as a very honest, punctual and committed girl. She was known to go out of her way to help patients, she said.She was a good girl, a good student and a good nurse. She was a disciplinarian. That may also be the reason why she had to face the kind of misery she did, Durga Mehta, then matron of the KEM Hospital and teacher to Aruna, told The Hindu. She is now settled in Amreli, Gujarat.Aruna was sodomised and strangled with a dog chain by a ward boy Sohanlal Valmiki, who was convicted and sentenced for seven years, though not for the crime he had committed. The strangulation cut oxygen supply to Aruna's brain. She also suffered brain stem contusion injury and cervical cord injury.I still remember the day it happened. After the sister-in-charge informed us, matron Beliman and I rushed to the basement. The moment she saw matron Beliman, tears started rolling down her eyes. She was conscious, she wanted to say something. Her lips were moving, but she could not speak up, Ms. Khushe said.We don't know when the incident happened. But I believe it was her will power that kept her conscious for all that period. Her condition was deplorable. Within 5-6 minutes after that she slipped into a coma and a team of doctors and neurosurgeons tried to pull her out of it, all in vain, she said.The one who put her through all this pain, got off with a light punishment, but she is still suffering, Ms. Khushe said.Her parents have passed away. She has a brother, but he himself is old. For four-five years after the incident, her niece used to come regularly and feed her. Then probably she got married and never returned, she said.Fianc stood by herBoth Ms. Khushe and Ms. Mehta remembered the way Aruna's fianc stood by her after the incident and religiously continued her physiotherapy treatment for years. Aruna was to get married within a month of the incident.He was a doctor serving with the hospital itself. He was a very nice boy. He took good care of her for years, Ms. Mehta said.Aruna was very fond of Sister Pokhlekar. She used to feel very happy after hearing her voice. Even Sister Pokhlekar took very good care of her. She used to personally supervise the staff caring for her, she said.Our dean Dr. Padma Pai had asked us to make Aruna wear colourful plastic bangles, just the way babies wear. We thought that would attract her to her hands, the sound would please her, Ms. Khushe said.Whenever I call her, she used to roll her eyes and turn around a bit. How can anyone say she does not respond, Ms. Mehta asked.Both of them acknowledged the efforts of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai in treating Aruna.The Corporation spent a lot of money for treating Aruna. They kept a separate bed reserved for her, and hired specialists for her treatment, Ms. Mehta said.Ms. Khushe reiterated how the staff of KEM Hospital had gone on strike when a dean decided to shift Aruna out of the hospital.All her friends protested against the decision and went on strike. They had to retract the decision, she said.She is ours. She is part of the KEM family. No one can take her away from us.

When two buses stop one after the other at a bus stop closer to a junction or signal, one can be sure that traffic in the area will come to a halt for a while.Bus stops in the city do not have a lay-by-bay for drivers to detour from the main road and park the buses. Even otherwise, the drivers never go to the extreme road boundary to stop the buses. They conveniently stop the buses in the middle of the road holding back the entire traffic behind them.Widening of roads and construction of bridges, elevated express ways and newer forms of transit systems are long-term plans that involve monetary constraints and budgetary allocations. But, there are a number of interim and ad-hoc solutions that the agencies concerned will have to initiate to ensure free flow of traffic, says K. Kathirmathiyon, Secretary of Coimbatore Consumer Cause.Recently, City Police Commissioner C. Sylendra Babu and Corporation Commissioner Anshul Mishra undertook a study of problematic bus stops that need to be relocated. The Transport Department, transport corporation and private bus operators should join hands with them to make the city roads free of traffic snarls.In cases where bus stops that were identified as problematic were relocated, passengers continue to stand at the place where the buses stopped originally and even the bus drivers continue to stop there. The police should deploy constables and the Transport Department its Motor Vehicle Inspectors to ensure that the passengers and bus crew comply with the changes in bus stop locations.Nellai Lala Corner bus stop on Raja Street near the Oppanakkara Street junction, Clock Tower bus stop, bus stops at Ramanathapuram signal - the one on Pankaja Mill Road immediately after the signal, the one on Tiruchi Road towards Singanallur and the other bus stop on Tiruchi Road towards Sungam near the signal - Lakshmi Mills junction, GP Theatre signal, Airport SITRA bus stop, 100 feet road bus stop, Mettupalayam Road near home science college, Sai Baba Kovil bus stop, two bus stops on DB Road and the bus stops near Women's Polytechnic need to be relocated.While doing so, the authorities should also create bus bays so that buses are not parked in the middle of the road.\",\n",

No, this is not about a young techie facing the prospects of some freak disease.Rather it's the cryptic rebuke through Twitter of a colleague's perceived subservience to management.Like the gadgets they use, the communication of young techies is getting shorter by the day. To put it in another way, from scrap' it has now shortened to tweet.'For a community largely deprived of social interaction owing to many factors including their odd working hours, virtual social space is the closest alternative. So, deny them access to social networking sites like Orkut, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and they are like fish out of water.There is a certain extent of addiction involved among the frequent users of these sites. I read in some blog that rumours about shutdown of Facebook created pandemonium, Arun S. Kumar, working with ACS, says.Vimal Raja C.A., working with Kochi-based MicroObjects Private Limited, says that there is more to these sites than addictive elements. Young entrepreneurs are increasingly using Facebook as a marketing tool realising its potential for revenue generation, he says.Adarsh S., IT manager with the Universal Empire Group, active in all social networking sites and moderator of many communities, has no doubt that if used properly, these sites even help build up professional networks.Antony Jijo, working for Millennium Infologic at Infopark, however, doubts such a prospect. When in need of professional help, most are likely to fall back on internal mail and such other support systems which most companies provide. Yes, they definitely keep relations alive, he says.Jinu Antony, waiting to be part of the TCS team this March, feels that if not anything, social networking sites will definitely keep one posted with the latest trends in IT and other fields.For, even if am not interested in any particular topic, I am automatically kept updated through my interactions with those genuinely interested, she says.Vimal, who religiously follows his childhood hero Salman Khan and the likes of Sashi Tharoor on Twitter through his smart phone, believes that at least among its users, tweets are about to dislodge SMS as the common medium of communication. Its hearing straight from your hero without any intermediary, he says.Arun, who more or less depends on Google Talk for interaction with his friends, scoffs at the idea of celebrity following on Twitter.I hate the entire idea. With the kind of fake people roaming around in these sites who knows who's who, he says. Adarsh agrees, saying that celebrities are using tweet just to market themselves.While Vimal counts meeting new people through numerous meet-ups organised by the social networking sites as memorable moments, Adarsh once had a completely unpleasant experience. He was the victim of one of the first cyber crimes registered in the city.Someone created an account in the Orkut using my picture and profile data and started posting pornographic materials, he says.The city police later nailed the victim.That being the case, even he agrees it is hard to ignore social networking sites. You don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies the supporters simply repeat the tagline of the latest Hollywood movie The Social Network.'If any further proof was needed on the popularity of social networking sites, then the Fincher-directed movie based on the origins of Facebook bagged numerous awards at the just concluded Golden Globe Awards, besides being a runaway hit at the box office.So, for the time-being, scrappers and tweeters are having the last laugh.M.P.

Complete physical and mental development is a must for a student to do well academically,\" said state project director, Bihar Education Project Council (BEPC), Rajesh Bhushan.In order to teach yoga, the government has created an army of about 1,100 trained yoga instructors. \"This army has been created in a mission-mode, so that the learners receive, along with quality education, training in living a healthy life,\" Bhushan added.In the first phase, under the guidance of experts from Patanjali Yog Peeth, Bharatiya Yog Sansthan, Patna University Yoga Kendra and Navjivan Yoga Centre, a seven-day-long yoga training programme was organised for physical teachers of schools from December 6 to 12 in 2009 in Patna.

The training programmes continued in a total of 22 districts over a period of five months. It started in September 2010 and continued till January 2011.\"Now, almost every school has a trained yoga teacher. These trained teachers will also have to train their associate teachers in their schools,\" said Ram Sagar Singh, programme officer of BEPC.\"We should encourage students to take up yoga classes.

It will help in keeping them away from drugs, improve their behavioral system and overcome all negative thoughts,\" said Mishra.But Mishra feels that the concept needs regular monitoring to achieve optimum results. \"The government has introduced yoga teaching, but it has no specific plan yet to monitor its implementation across the state,\" he said.The idea of yoga teaching is the brainchild of HRD principal secretary Anjani Kumar Singh.

It is an interaction with creation, and is not a religion.\" \"Yoga does not ban anything. I have experienced everything there is to experience,\" he adds while revealing he has eaten pork, beef and consumed alcohol but now has just one meal a day and is a fit 110 kg.Speaking to STOI, the yogi was critical of the commercialization of yoga. \"There are a lot of people fooling people in the name of yoga. It is very easy to wear robes, grow a beard...it has become so rampant,\" says Ashwini.Seek his opinion on Baba Ramdev\\'s sprawling empire, and he retorts, \"What is he enjoying? He is constantly under the media glare. The DRI (Directorate of Revenue Intelligence) is after him.\"While many may associate gurus, sadhus and yogis with austerity, the yogi affirms that this is a wrong notion and feels there is nothing wrong in \"making money and enjoying it\".Besides yoga, he has other interests too.

Ipas would provide technical assistance to the state government in implementing the scheme which would be available to women free of cost.Inaugurating the scheme, health minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey said the scheme is a significant step in the direction of improving women's health. It would help reduce maternal mortality rate in the state, which at 312 is more than the national average of 254 per lakh. Around 100 private clinics would be empanelled every year to provide free abortion services to the women. Health workers such as Asha personnel and ANMs would be imparted training to generate awareness about safe abortion services.Choubey expressed concern over dwindling sex ratio in the state. According to 2011 census, the male: female ratio in the state is 1000:916, which was 1000:921 in 2001, he said and added population control measures also need to be adopted as the state's total fertility rate is 3.9%, higher than 2.6% nationally.Health secretary Sanjay Kumar said abortion is legal in India since 1971. However, safe and legal abortion services are not easily available. Five lakh abortions take place every year in Bihar, most of which are unsafe and performed in unhygienic condition by untrained professionals. The 'Yukti' initiative would make safe abortion services available at government hospitals and private health sites, he said.Kumar said the scheme is open to private sector health sites, willing to work together with the state government. These health sites would provide free abortion services up to 12 weeks' gestation period and treat abortion complications. The state government would reimburse the cost of drugs as well as other recurring costs.Ipas country director Vinoj Manning said around 80% of abortions are unsafe and illegal. The 'Yukti' scheme would help women exercise their right to safe abortions.A toll free number (1800 102 84 64) was also launched on the occasion. Details regarding the service can be gathered by making a call to this number. State minister for social welfare Parveen Amanullah, who was the chief guest on the occasion, launched the service by dialling the number.

What is worse, the shopkeepers have sublet their properties at some places and are minting money while the NMC remains the loser.Taking such issues into consideration, Joshi even held a surprise check on certain markets last week, ahead of the budget to take stock of the situation.Dalal had proposed to revise the fee and rental for each shop for a period of 2, 3 or 5 years as per the ready reckoner of town planning department for 2010.

According to investment advisers, they get queries regularly from investors looking for higher returns to beat the likely higher inflation in future.\"Inflation going up in the short term is a possibility. For example, oil prices continue to be high and if the government chose to pass it on after the elections, there could be a spurt in inflation in the short term,\" says Lovaii Navlakhi, MD & chief financial planner, International Money Matters, a Bangalore-based financial firm. \"However, fundamentally you won\\'t have only inflation ruling highin thelong term. Either it will come down or deposit rates would catch up with it,\" he says.Experts also believe that fixed income investors had a good time in the recent past because of rising interest rates. \"This is really a good time for fixed income investors. After a long time they are getting real rate of returns,\" says Maneesh Dangi, head of fixed income, Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund. \"The inflation has been in the band of 6-8% in the last one year, whereas the rate of oneyear CD has gone up from 5% to 10%. For example, a oneyear CD is quoting around 9.80% at the moment,\" he adds. He also thinks that fixed income investors are likely to benefit more if the inflation continues to remain high in the next one year. \"If we take the average inflation of 7.5% and compare it with one-year shortterm rate of 10%, that is a spread of around 250 basis points (2.5%).

Manufacturers are losing a precious two-and-a-half to three working hours everyday as industry suffers a staggering 16 hours of load-shedding on one day in a week.Power expert Ashok Pendse, who also owns a small industrial unit in Thane, said, \"As industrialists we lose 15% on productivity and up to 20% on profits as we have to pay workers even if there is no production.\"He said even if the state gets about 1500 to 1700 MW extra, the situation will improve only partially as it will not be able to meet the full demand. \"Despite the help, a shortfall of minimum 2000 MW remains. If the industry switches to diesel generation sets for three to four hours when the power demand is at its peak in the morning and evening, the state will be able to save around 1100 MW in consumption and thus reduce load-shedding,a? he said.Pendse said industries now use gensets when they donat get power and suggested that the authorities direct the industry to do so during peak hours in such emergency situations, to reduce consumption and thus save power which will ultimately reduce load-shedding hours.However, P V Krishna, director general of the Indian Electrical Equipment Manufacturersa Association (IEEMA), differs. He said if industry has to use diesel gensets during peak hours, their electricity cost would be Rs 15 per unit against the normal average of Rs 6 for thermal power.\"Instead of this, I would think there should be a very sensible, practical and sustainable solution on the lines of the Pune model. In Pune, the state power suppliers compensated industrial consumers for generating power through diesel gensets and recovered the money by adding reliability charges in consumer billing,\"said Krishna. He admitted the fact that industrial consumers were losing precious working hours amid such a power crunch owing to coal which is wet and in short supply.Pendse said the national power exchange had 1200 MW power available on Wednesday with it but state refused to buy as its costs were very high up to Rs 6 or 7 per unit and may be higher up to Rs 8. \"If to buy, imposing additional cost of Rs 2 to Rs 4 (as stateas average power purchase cost is around Rs 4.10 per unit) on consumers or government would again be a complicated and sensitive proposition,\"he said. However, he said sharing the cost among high-paying consumers, commoners and government for a period of contingency can be a solution.Another power expert, D Radhakrishna, said open access (freedom to buy power from outside or the open market) would be a long-term and better solution to meet the power demand in such a crisis.asA loss of two-and-a-half to three working hours means a financial loss of about 20%,a? said Radhakrishna who is a power consultant to industries in the state. \"Losses in mechanical industries are more than 20%. Industries which run on generators will have power costs of more than Rs 12 per unit and will not be able to compete with neighbouring Dadra Nagar Haveli or Gujarat,\" he added.However, a state power ministry official said 16 hours of load-shedding on one day every week has been there for long. \"Despite withdrawing that load-shedding, industryas output has not improved much. Load-shedding at present is temporary and will be over soon. However, better models on the lines of Pune can be tried and tested in the benefit of industrial as well as common residential consumers,\"said the official.',\n",

The order freezes release of all development and non-plan expenditure by government departments.By this, the finance department has ended up issuing back-to-back orders and blocked release of all funds, whether for development or sundry expenses, needed for smooth governance. Both chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his colleague in the finance department are taking care not to expose the government\\'s dire straits before its own employees, who comprise a considerable section of the electorate.

Dasgupta has also sent finance secretary C M Bachhawat to Delhi for seeking funds from the Union finance ministry.On March 31, the finance secretary had gone to the capital to seek permission to go for market borrowings. The department of expenditure, under the ministry of finance, kept its approval pending since the government has asked for excess borrowings. As per rules, the Bengal government can only borrow Rs 1,282 crore, which is a 12th of the total market borrowing limit pledged by itself.The state at the moment is not confident of any help from the Centre, especially after Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee\\'s press conference on Monday, where he accused the debt-ridden state of financial mismanagement.

It is taking the help of consultants and people from outside to fill the gap of executing regulatory tasks essential to ensure flyer safely.Zaidi and Bhushan  who took over these positions about three to four months back  are learnt to have decided to take people from Airports Authority, Pawan Hans, the helicopter provider, and airlines to help its skeletal staff check all 40 flying schools as well as papers of all pilots.The reshuffled people from the exam and licensing branches to get relatively cleaner officials  or at least those whose children are not serving as pilots in airlines  to man these departments. But a manpower crunch also means there is very little choice for reshuffling.Before the scam broke out, the shortage of staff meant files moving very slowly unless some external pressure  either bakshish or calls from the ministry  was exerted. \"Even people genuinely aspiring to get their co-pilot or commander licence found it hard to get work done on time. Demands for greasing palms were common for things like submitting papers to take an exam or getting roll numbers.\"\"Then submitting papers to get licences issued meant more bakshish otherwise papers would get \\'lost\\' or miniscule errors would be pointed out to keep holding back the desired papers,\" said sources.In fact, the US Federal Aviation Administration had threatened to downgrade Indian aviation to sub-Sahara African level two years ago due to a weak DGCA even as air traffic here grew at an astonishing 20% rate.\"The directorate of flying training has no personnel. We have 600 posts for technical personnel and as many support staff posts created for the proposed Civil Aviation Authority that will eventually replace the DGCA. Unless that happens, there is little that the DGCA can do in its current weak form,\" admitted people involved in the cleanup after the scam said.',\n",

The two-day event is being organised at HICC by the Andhra Pradesh Realtors Association (APRA), the local chapter of the national body of realtors.Speaking on Day 1 of the event, P S N Rao, founder chairman of NAR-India termed the collaboration as historic as he stressed on the need for builders and brokers to work in cooperation to ensure better growth of the real estate sector. \"Brokers and builders are two key stakeholders of this industry. It is thus imperative that a synergy is cultivated between the two. This MoU will ensure just that,\" Rao said adding how this move would also help improve the credibility of real estate agents. \"Until a few years ago, customers scoffed at the mention of a property broker. Things are gradually changing now with more educated and sophisticated people turning realtors. We at NAR-India too are making all efforts to change this perception and our association with CREDAI is just another step towards that goal,\" Rao said.NAR-India at present has close to 13,000 members spread across 20 states.

It is a very important proposal, which if implemented will ensure that a customer gets all clearances within three weeks. Similarly there are other concerns that we are trying to resolve gradually,\" he said.While Jain preferred to keep mum on the Telangana crisis and its impact on Hyderabad\\'s realty, he said that a rise in property prices over the next few years was inevitable.',\n",

Traffic jams, arguments with rickshaw pullers and increased noise pollution - residents on Lala Lajpat Rai Path in East of Kailash have been at the receiving end on many fronts since last October.At the root of their new problems, residents say, are the dozens of cycle rickshaws that descend upon the station to provide last-mile connectivity to commuters. As they crowd the road, these rickshaws also block the gates of houses just ahead of the station. \"During the day, at least 20 rickshaws are parked outside my house.

The members of the royal household, who were devotees of the Goddess, wanted to organize Durga Puja on a grand scale by the riverbank, with sacrifices being offered to the revered goddess, and this led to the inception of the puja.

So, the problems are deeper than what the data shows.\"On digging, a particularly annoying problem round the year, the municipal rule is that permission for it should not be given unless the situation is an emergency. Also, digging is supposed to stop by May 31, that is before the monsoon. But while complaints against digging numbered 52 in June-Sep 2008, they are way beyond half that, at 32, in June-July 2011.NV Merani, chairman, Standing Technical Advisory Committee (STAC), said the problem was an absence of a monitoring mechanism. \"The BMC starts paying attention to issues primarily when the media highlights them. Complaints come and get accumulated. What is needed is a public grievance committee in every ward, with citizens and BMC officials as members.\"We had recommended that such a committee be set up, so that complaints could be addressed on a regular basis and not just during the monsoon. If basic considerations are not made, how can change be expected?\"Mumbai deserves a better fate than to be left at the mercy of nature each monsoon. Calling it a global city, given that people die here every year of reasons like cratered roads and crashing trees, is a cruel joke on its residents. What is more galling is the administration\\'s refusal to learn a lesson from such futile loss of life. An honest admission of at least partial responsibilitybe it for a biker\\'s death on a potholed road or a morning walker\\'s death caused by a falling tree in a parkis the first step towards giving Mumbaikars a better quality of life.',\n",

However, if the figures of illegal mining are added, which is substantial, the resources will get exhausted in a much shorter period and raise a serious question on inter-generation equity,\" it said.The CEC had in the last nine years never come across such colossal illegal mining though it had inquired into such activities in Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Orissa.It said, \"All these cases pale into insignificance when compared to illegal mining on a colossal scale that has taken place in the state of Karnataka, particularly in district Bellary and that too with the active connivance of officials of the concerned departments and also public representatives.\"The Lokayukta\\'s report gave examples of all-round illegalities committed by officials in allowing mining activityin forests and other areas, but hardly any corrective measure was taken by the state government, it said.\"The mining leases, found to be involved in illegal mining, continued with their activities.

Autorickshaws pick up children from their homes and drop them at respective schools, while buses pick up kids from a designated stop in a locality and drop them at the same. But since not many school managements have bus service, a majority of parents are forced to opt for three-wheelers or depend on their own vehicles.Vishakha Wagolikar, a parent, said: \"My child\\'s auto driver carries five children in his vehicle and till last academic year we were paying him Rs 700 a month.

The crisis has also adversely affected the work of couple of upcoming sponge iron units in Mul tehsil.Sponge iron industries are comparatively low cost industries and are established at places where its raw material, coal and iron ore, is readily available In Maharashtra the cluster of sponge iron industries has come up in Chandrapur, a coal abundant area, however the poor mineral policy of state in relation to these industries has pushed them into grave difficulty.There are seven sponge iron units in Chandrapur district. Gupta Metalics Ltd located at Chunala in Rajura tehsil closed its unit permanently, while other six are reeling under grave raw material crisis.\"Irregularities busted in iron ore mines in Karnataka and Odisha has led to this situation.

Chaman Metalics has shut down its operations since some weeks.He claimed that sponge-iron industries came to Chandrpaur as coal, one of the two raw materials they need, is readily available here. Iron ore mines in Hospate and Billari in Karnataka were main source of iron ore for industries here. \"It is liability of state government to ensure availability of iron ore, the other raw material we needed. There are huge deposits of iron ore in Surjagarh in Gadchiroli and industries have obtained mining blocks there, thanks to Naxal hurdle none have dared to start mining of the mineral,\" Sharma said. He maintained that government should resolve Naxal problem and pave the way for iron ore mining in Gadchiroli district.President of Chandrapur MIDC Industries Association Madhusudan Rungta informed that raw material crisis has led to direct loss of government revenue of Rs 12 crores per month obtained against excise duty from sponge iron units here. In addition to this there is a loss of revenue of Rs 6 crore per month against the sales tax from these units. \"While there is loss of government revenue, the continuation of crisis could lead to employment problem.

Officials here hint that any ban on mining may lead to a crisis in power generation.In an official statement, the company has said it will continue mining in its existing projects even if they fall under metro region. These mines are in Kamptee-Saoner area and WCL says that they are mostly feeding state power utility - Mahagenco - power plants in the region.WCL officials say that existing mines near Kamptee and Saoner are a mix of opencast and underground mines. Their total output of four million tones a year accounts for almost 10% of WCL's total output and 20% of the amount is supplied to Mahagenco. Almost entire quantity mined here goes to local power plants, which may face a crisis if the mines or replacement plans are stopped, said a WCL official.The press release further says that even work on new mines will take off as they are planned as replacements for existing ones, which cater to local power stations.The statement comes in the backdrop of chief minister Prithviraj Chavan's visit to the city, during which he assured to convince the ministry of coal to ban mining within 5km of the city and allow only underground mining within 10km.In the two types of mines - underground and opencast - the former is like a tunnel but in the latter the entire area is literally ripped open, which requires a large area of land and leads to higher pollution too.Chavan has asked WCL and NIT to submit their respective draft plans to him so that the matter can be pursued with ministry of coal.The whole issue about mines being opened in proposed Nagpur Metro Region, which extends city by 20km outside its existing boundaries, came to fore after Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) had asked WCL about the existence of coal deposits in the area. WCL had reverted with a map identifying the coal-bearing areas.The release added that the coal-bearing areas running from north to southeast corridor are amenable to underground mining and are yet to be allotted to any agency, which may be WCL or a private player. However, even as WCL is maintaining that the said blocks are not its property yet, it is also eyeing some mines there. Coal India Limited, which is parent company of WCL, is trying to get three coal blocks in the metro region itself.These are Sangam, Sillori and Bharatwada blocks situated in north to south east corridor flanking metro region from the west. The first two are beyond 10km of the city while Bharatwada block is within 10km, said a senior company official.It may take at least 10 years for mining to finally start in this corridor. There are two more mining blocks in the region - Bina Bhanegon and Singori block in the north direction, which is already under WCL possession with the process of land acquisition underway, where they have plans for opencast mining.\",\n",

Then, a year later, he started the beer bar and restaurant without discussing it with the society members.The protesters said that though they had reported the matter to the cops, it was of no use. \"The cops said that he had some political connections and he had taken permission from them,\" said Suchita Bhusari, a resident, who is a lecturer.Not only has the liquor shop changed the society atmosphere, but also created a feeling of insecurity among young girls. \"Earlier, there was no problem in coming late in the evening after tuitions, but from past one month, since the liquor shop was set up, we have had to change our tuition timings,\" said an 18-year-old first year physiotherapy student.Another girl, Rachana Joshi, a first-year engineering student, said that due to the abusive comments passed by drunkards, she had stopped peeping out of the windows or going out into the balcony.Hoping that the protest will shut down the bar, Trusha Raut, a teacher, said, \"We hope this protest will bring back the peace in our society and very soon we can see the children playing in the society again.\"',\n",

With numbers for the last two months unavailable, outward remittances under RBI's Liberalized Remittance Scheme are on course to cross the $1 billion mark for the first time.Under LRS, resident Indian individuals are permitted to spend $200,000 (around Rs 90 lakh) annually for specified purposes, including investment, education and medical treatment. A decline in overseas deposits is on expected lines, considering the recent increase in interest rates in India, which has resulted in banks offering up to 10% on fixed deposits. Besides, the financial health of overseas banks is still a cause for concern for many in the country.What would, however, come as a surprise is a decline in remittances for overseas education that dipped over 35% during April-January (see table). While there has been a decline in the number of students going to Australia, a large part of the traffic has been diverted to other countries.But the rise in unemployment in the US and Europe, which are yet to recover from the impact of the financial crisis, might have forced several Indians to remit more funds overseas for maintenance of close relatives. Thanks to the over 71% increase to $226 million, this has become the single-biggest head for overseas remittance.The other big increase is in case of gifts which saw a near 61% rise during April-January 2010-11 to almost touch the $200 million mark. And, with Indian stock markets not offering returns that were seen in 2009 and 2010, retail investors seem to have taken a fancy for investing in overseas markets.

However in 2015, the number will break the one crore barrier mark - 1.04 crore in the age group 20-29 years.What\\'s really stark is the tremendous gap in the number of rural and urban Indians in this age group suffering from CHD. While in 2000, 17.99 lakh rural Indians aged 20-29 and 27.1 lakh urban Indians suffered from CHD, the gap would increase to 23.24 lakh rural and 81 lakh urban Indians in 2015, showing clearly how heart disease would jump manifold in young urban Indians due to their faulty lifestyle.The rural-urban divide in the numbers is also going to be widest in 2015. While in 2000, rural Indians suffered more from CHD than urban Indians (1.4 crores against 1.2 crore respectively), the number would stand at 2.5 crore rural and 3.6 crore urban Indians from CHD in 2015.However, in all the four years (2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015) the age group with highest number of CHD patients stands at 40-49 years.

Over time, the walls of your arteries can become narrow with fatty deposits known as atherosclerosis. If your coronary arteries become narrow, the blood supply gets restricted causing angina (chest pains). If a coronary artery becomes completely blocked, it causes a heart attack.',\n",

The joint press conference on Tuesday demonstrated the Centre\\'s insistence that there be no dilution in the commitment to build the 10,000 mw nuclear park which will house French built reactors.While a new law for an independent nuclear regulator, safety measures and fulsome compensation have been promised, the Centre is obviously keen to make a statement that India\\'s civil nuclear energy programme is not going to change course after the disaster at Japan\\'s Fukushima plant.The press conference was preceded by a meeting of the nuclear establishment called by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with Chavan and Ramesh also attending. The meeting assessed the progress of Jaitapur and other nuclear power issues.A release from the PMO said, \"It was noted that the Jaitapur project would be implemented in a phased manner with two 1650 MWe reactors to begin with.\"Narayanasamy said a bill would be introduced in the next session of Parliament to set up an independent Nuclear Regulatory Authority of India, which would subsume the existing Atomic Energy Regulatory Board.He added that a new compensation package was being worked out for those affected by Jaitapur power plant and the details would be announced soon.Both Ramesh and Chavan sought to distinguish between \\'local protests\\' and outsiders in Jaitapur and said they did not expect any reconciliation with those ideologically opposed to nuclear power. Chavan said the state government would try to resolve the concerns of the local people.The PM\\'s meeting also resolved to put results of the six safety studies conducted in wake of Fukushima disaster in the public domain. The action taken on previous safety reports would also be made public. The government would also invite International Atomic Energy Agency\\'s operational safety review team to assist in safety audits.In a bid to defuse concerns about imported reactors, the note from the PMO said, \"While imported reactors have their place, indigenously-designed and developed reactors will continue to be at the very foundation of this programme.\" The explanation was intended to counter the criticism that the government\\'s nuclear power policy revolves around deals with foreign suppliers.Each of the reactors at Jaitapur and at all future sites would have standalone safety features. But announcing this as a new measure post-Fukushima was questioned as it was pointed out that each of the existing reactors already has such a safety system.The press note said the PM underscored that safety of nuclear power plants was a matter of highest priority and that there was a need for improving public communication and outreach on the part of the Department of Atomic Energy and NPCIL.

The Delhi Metro is expected to start work on the Janpath station next week, installing traffic barriers along the Janpath road. While a traffic plan has been put in place, the diversions are likely to cause traffic disruptions . The work is scheduled to go on for almost a year, with the road being closed in sections.Sources in the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) said that barricades are going to be put in place to manage the traffic, along with traffic marshals who will monitor the intersections at all times. Said a senior DMRC official, \"Since the station is underground, only a section of the road will be dug up as we will use the cut and cover method. The work will be done in sections.\" The road from Tolstoy Marg to Windsor Place is the section which will be most affected due to the Metro construction. This will be closed for general traffic from next week.As per the traffic plan for the period, vehicles will be diverted through Tolstoy Marg, Kasturba Gandhi Marg and Parliament Street. Since Janpath is an arterial road, the area sees significant traffic movement, say traffic officials. However, signage will be in place, advisories will be issued and traffic police deployed to ensure smooth movement of vehicles , added officials. Partial movement of traffic will be allowed from Windsor Place to Western Court for commuters visiting buildings along either side of the road. Traffic police is also planning to allow one-lane paid parking on either side of the carriageway on Janpath. This is to provide easy passage for people wanting to visit Janpath market or buildings near Tolstoy Marg. There will be a Uturn from where the Metro work begins on Janpath, but only vehicles parked there can use the stretch, which is otherwise closed for general traffic.Traffic on the five other radial roads of Windsor Place and other parts of CP is likely to be affected as well. This is because Ashoka Road, Raisina Road and Janpath road on the other side of Windsor Place are expected to be affected due to the closing down. Officials expect a \"ripple effect\" on all these other roads. This is expected to be heightened by the ongoing renovation work that NDMC has planned for CP. So brace for slow traffic, especially during peak hours, warn traffic cops.',\n",

A majority of the striking nurses have decided to collect their certificates and quit. \"At least 80% of us are not willing to stay back. We will collect the certificates and start our job hunt,\" said M Matthew, a nurse. He said the nurses found the work environment \"stressful and harassing\". The strike was triggered by one of their colleagues, Beena Baby (21), committing suicide on Tuesday.The stand-off has resulted in cancellation and postponement of surgeries. Some patients said that only a handful of nurses was attending to most of the patients. Hospital insiders as well as the striking nurses said that relatives of at least two patients moved them to another hospital. The hospital management, however, has maintained that 50 nurses were looking after the patients.AHI vice-chairman and cardiac surgeon Dr Ramakant Panda said on Saturday that another 20 nurses had resumed worked. \"We had 80 more nurses at our disposal. They were hired as the hospital is planning to increase its bed strength by 100,\" he added. Panda said the nurses will get their original certificates back.\"The nurses can stay in the hospital quarters for 10 days even if they resign,\" he said. The hospital, however, stood by its decision to re-interview the nurses before taking them back.

Traffic jams, arguments with rickshaw pullers and increased noise pollution  residents on Lala Lajpat Rai Path in East of Kailash have been at the receiving end on many fronts since last October.At the root of their new problems, residents say, are the dozens of cycle-rickshaws that descend upon the station to provide last-mile connectivity to commuters. As they crowd the road, these rickshaws also block the gates of houses just ahead of the station. \"During the day, at least 20 rickshaws are parked outside my house. If I want to take out my car, I have to first clear the way,\" said A K Jindal, whose house is just two buildings away from the station. \"It takes 5-10 minutes to enter our house.\"With rickshaws choking the left half of the narrow carriageway, and residents waiting to turn left into their gates behind them, jams have become the norm at the traffic signal outside the station. Traffic headed towards Nehru Place suffers the most as the right half of the road remains occupied by vehicles waiting to turn right towards Kailash Colony.\"Rickshaws block the carriageway and cause long jams on this road, especially during peak hours. To add to the problem, autorickshaws also stop outside the Metro station to pick up passengers. Ever since the station was made operational last year, driving on this stretch has become a nightmare,\" said Manoj, who works at a showroom in East of Kailash.Residents say they had anticipated this mess and opposed the building of the station at its present location, however the Metro and other government agencies had promised them that parking of rickshaws on the main road would be made \"illegal and punishable\" to ensure smooth traffic flow.\"I was assured that all measures would be taken to ensure that residents, especially those who have houses on the main road, do not face any problem. In a reply to my letter, Delhi Metro had clarified that parking of rickshaws and autorickshaws would be illegal and punishable.

However, the temple authorities haven't received by study report till Thursday.During telephonic conversation with the additional chief executive officer of KVT, Om Prakash Goswami, on Thursday, the NRLCCP director hinted that this time, they have prepared the study report after conducting laboratory tests of the samples of stones taken from the KVT.The NRLCCP has prepared an estimate of about Rs 1.25 crore to remove the enamel paint from the artistic stone walls of the KVT, admitted Goswami.It's worth mentioning here that in July 2009, the NRLCCP had examined the effects of enamel paint on the walls of KVT for the first time. That exercise had made it clear that the use of enamel paint on KVT walls was a blunder.The porous stone absorbs water along with salts and minerals through capillary action. And, if coated with a plastic paint, the stone does not allow moisture to go out, ultimately causing damage to the stone.After examination, the NRLCCP, a scientific institution of the central ministry of culture dedicated to the conservation of cultural heritage, estimated a cost of Rs 2.19 crore for removing the enamel paint from the stone walls.However, considering this proposal as impractical due to high budget, the Kashi Vishwanath Temple Trust rejected it and decided to seek advice from the experts of other institutions.Goswami said that the state unit of Archeological Survey of India and the Dyes and Food Adulterant Toxicological Division, ITRC, Lucknow, again recommended the name of NRLCCP for this job as it had the expertise in this work.During its last meeting, the trust office bearers and members invited the NRLCCP director on December 17, 2010, when a presentation session was conducted. After it, the NRLCCP was asked to prepare a fresh study report and estimate.The NRLCCP was asked to submit its report by December end but the process of laboratory tests of the samples collected from KVT delayed this process and the report was finalised in the last week of March.The NRLCCP sent its report to chief executive officer of KVT, Sanjay Singh Yadav. But Yadav said that the report has not reached his office as yet.Goswami said that immediately after arrival of this report, the date for the next meeting of trust members would be decided to finalise this matter. Goswami said that if the trust would give its approval to the study report and estimate of NRLCCP, it would be forwarded to the state government for its nod.After these exercises, the budget would be sanctioned. Even after completion of all these exercises, the restoration of the temple and treatment of stone, which is a long process, may take a time of 1 to 2 years.# The KVT, which has one of the 12 jyotirlingas of Lord Shiva, is facing a serious threat to its architectural marvel due to five-six coatings of the enamel paint on the stone walls# The temple is an architectural marvel built way back in 1777 by late Maharani Ahilya Bai Holkar of Indore. Punjab Kesari Maharaja Ranjeet Singh donated gold to cover its dome in 1839.# The harmful impact of plastic paint became visible several years back. But, the attention of temple administration and government machinery was drawn towards it when Shatrudra Prakash, general secretary of Citizen Forum and former UP minister, demanded a white paper on the application of enamel paint and the reasons behind the delay in removing the paint, and the persons responsible for this act.# After it, the temple trust decided to consult the officials of ASI to assess the harm done to the temple by the chemical paint and ensure appropriate remedial action.Box: The National Research Laboratory for Conservation of Cultural Property (NRLCCP)# The NRLCCP is a scientific institution of the central ministry of culture dedicated to the conservation of cultural heritage.

Amid all this we seem to have forgotten the curse of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) that has always existed and ignored its might which is altering demographics and stunting development and impacting economic growth everywhere.Diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and chronic respiratory diseases are growing in proportion and affecting more people especially in the prime of their lives. Last month, the UN General Assembly introduced the Bill for the prevention and control of NCDs with a particular focus on developmental and other challenges especially in the developing countries. Indians, with apple-shaped central obesity and a penchant for rather unhealthy diet loaded with fats and sugary fried foods have to be ultra careful.Unfortunately, genetically bequeathed with cardiovascular dysfunction in the inner lining of arteries, the tendency for Indians to develop coronary blocks (heart attacks) or cerebrals thrombosis (strokes) is deeply rooted. So much so that when you follow up Indian families long migrated to Canada and US and study their third generation (born and reared there), the incidence of cardiovascular disease is higher than their local neighbours and equals those of their cousins back home here.By the end of this decade, every fifth Indian will be diabetic. Shockingly, the age at diagnosis is dropping to even the late twenties. While it may sound like a science fiction novel, NCDs in reality are devastating lives and crippling healthcare worldwide. Is this the price that we are willing to pay for being an emerging, tech-savvy, liberalized, open door economy? Or is this emanating from our \"evolved\" lazy lifestyles and \"food faddism\" that is riding piggyback on genetic propensities?It is easy to enrol at a stylish gym and dip bread only in olive oil but the ad blitzkrieg of fried snacks, transfat foods and even subtle intoxicants opens up a deluge of fodder for the arteries of the community. Indian pharmaceutical firms are the most profitable because statins, blood thinners, anti-diabetic and \\'BP\\' drugs are gobbled up by the vast multiple of patients, who are victims of lifestyle diseases.The question raised by the UN resolution on NCDs is-Can we go back one step and prevent the attack on our cells and organs, rather than flood the body with medication which comes at a price and its share of adverse effects. Sandwiched between World Heart Day (September) and the upcoming World Diabetes Day (November) and of course Diwali round the corner, health authorities should devise a strategy that aims at prevention. Since you cannot take your \"genes\" to the laundry you can at least feed them correctly and give them some mode of exerciseeven simple walking.Even doctors have started emphasizing \"lifestyle alterations\" before medication and this means the plate, the playground, the body and the spirit ; for the mind rules them all.

Amul not only leads in cheese slices (69%) and cheese cubes (98%), but spreads (70%) as well.However, according to Britannia, the value share of its brand Milkman is around 30% in the overall cheese market. A Britannia Industries spokesperson said: \"The Nielsen data pickup for cheese covers a very small population of outlets and hence is not a representative sample size for accurate extrapolation. Basis the data of all Cheese manufacturers in India, we have a value share of approximately 30% in the overall retail Cheese market and a share of approx 40% in modern trade formats.\"The size of the cheese market in India is estimated to be around Rs 400 crore.

Go is also aggressively pushing its product in modern retail format stores through discounts and heavy margins. For instance, currently, on Go cheese slices (200 gm pack of MRP Rs 91), there is a consumer offer of two-wedge pack worth Rs 20 free in certain modern retail stores. In certain stores, there was also an additional discount of Rs 11 per pack, which brings the effective price to the consumer down to Rs 60. As a result of the marketing initiatives undertaken by Gowardhan, Go has grown by nearly 80% since Q1 2009.GCMMF, on the other hand, has focused on widespread distribution of Amul to smaller cities and towns through its chilled distribution highway.The competitive scenario in cheese is expected to keep the engagement of companies with consumer active for some time now.

Customers\\' were calling on the mobile phones from across the country.Another bookie Harish was collecting the \\'match rate\\' from the internet and filling it across the names of the customers\\' who had placed their betting odds in the Pune versus Kochi match.Police sources said that the gang had set base in Kashimira ahead of the World Cup matches.

The lack of a proper redistribution mechanism can seriously hamper response to emergencies.For example, Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital, where most of the blast victims have been admitted, had to evacuate its surgery wards to accommodate the blast victims . The hospital received about 60 victims in the first hour of the blast after 10.15am.

The chhath fast stretches to more than 36 hours and the rituals that are observed over four days are stringent enough to daunt even the most spiritually inclined.The festival is steeped in tradition and requires paraphernalia which is not very easily available especially to those who are staying away from their native place.Ideally the rituals begin with a holy dip in Ganga and fasting for the entire day and late in the evening the fast is broken after performing puja at home. The next day marks the beginning of the thirty-six hour fast. The day is devoted to preparation of the evening worship.The offerings consist of seasonal fresh fruits, vegetables and lentils along with deep fried sweets made with rice flour called thekuwa and khajure. These are placed in a soop, and carried to the river bank where the women offer arghya to the setting sun.Sadhana Jha, a city based entrepreneur says, \"We go to Ambazari lake to offer arghya but the problem is that it is a tank with still water and the arghya is a mix of milk and water, so where we stand the water there gets very milky with so many of us doing puja. There are many of us who have now built big tanks in the neighbourhood to perform this puja.\"The third day is crucial and women prepare to offer worship to the rising sun. The puja soop is prepared once again and kept under a canopy made from sugarcane in which earthen lamps are placed.Saroj Singh, a homemaker who writes on Bhojpuri websites says, \"Pavitrata is paramount in this festival. So we wear brand new saris to which even falls have not been stitched. The sindoor is worn differently. We call it joda sindhoor, it is applied from the tip of the nose till the end of the parting in the hair. As the sun rises we enter the water and stand navel deep facing eastward to offer arghya.\"The three-day festival is marked by singing of chhath geet.Preeti Sinha, a homemaker says, \"Traditional chhath songs are sung to keep the spirits high of the women who fast for nearly 36 hours. Songs like Konpi Konpi Bolalen Suruj Dev, O Chhatthi Maiya, Karab Raori Seva and Raoure Sevaitye Mora Nirmal Kaya are all prayers offered to the sun god and to Chhath devi.\"Considering the rising number of Biharis in the city, the Bihar Sanskrit Mandal too is taking cognisance of the difficulties faced by the worshippers.SP Singh, secretary of the organization says, \"Indeed the women use to face a lot of problems while offering arghya as the ground is slippery and the area is small. But now we have built cement stairs and also have started setting up collapsible iron stairs to help women who enter the water get a foothold.\"Benefits of Chhath PujaThe Chhath practice improves immunity of the bodyAntiseptic effect: Safe radiation of sunlight can help cure fungal and bacterial infections of the skinRaktavardhak (increase in fighting power of blood): As a consequence of the practice of Chhath, the energy infused in the blood stream improves the performance of white blood cells. The solar energy has a great influence on glands which results in balanced secretion of hormonesEnergy requirements are met by the solar energy directly. This will further detoxify the body Chhath Dhyan SadhanaAssume a comfortable position (standing or sitting) with back and spine straight. With eyes closed, face the Sun. Inhale completely, as slowly as possible. Do not strain in making the breathing slow. As you breathe in, visualize the cosmic solar energy entering through your eyes and moving to the pineal gland through optic nerves and charging the pineal-pituitary-hypothalamus complex.

We advise mutual funds for the short term as well. They are equally liquid. But this deposit will act as a saving that you don\\'t have to monitor,\" she added. Mutual funds for the short term? Was she referring to liquid funds? \"No , equity funds which give 12-15 % returns,\" the RM clarified. We shifted to a quiet corner to discuss long-term investments.\"I suggest you opt for an equity-oriented plan with an attached life cover,\" she said. I interrupted her with information she felt no need for: \"But I have no dependants. Is that not why people buy insurance?\" Her reply was quick: \"You earn 65,000 a month.So your life has some value for your parents and husband.\" To think so long I had assumed my parents loved me for reasons other than my salary. Will I also land a husband with mercenary motivations? The RM started listing the products I ought to invest in. No guesses, a Ulip was the first suggestion.\"Our company launched this scheme which is a huge hit. Let\\'s say you invest 50,000 as premium. You get a life cover of 5 lakh and earn returns. The lock-in is for five years. If you invest for seven years, there is a highest NAV guarantee ,\" she said. It was the word I was dreading - guarantee. I asked her to explain the concept of highest NAV. \"Let\\'s suppose the NAV is 10 when you invest. During the seven years, the market reaches a peak of, say, 21000 and the NAV becomes 20. Your profit will be booked on that day. Even if the market goes down and your NAV declines, you will get the returns as per the NAV of 20,\" she answered.It sounded like a dream deal. Unless you knew how insurers fix the highest NAV. The link to the market movement was as much fiction as my marriage. (see What is wrong). What about returns? \"At least 15%. The company launches these products regularly . The word \\'guaranteed\\' is there. You will at least get 15% return if you stay for five years,\" she said emphatically.Trying to sound evasive, I mentioned traditional insurance plans. \"I can offer them, madam, but they give low returns. At your age you can play with your money . So invest in the market. Also, in moneyback policies, the bonus depends on how the company performs. You can\\'t predict how much you will get. Ulips are the best insurance,\" she concluded.Assured returns from equities and uncertain returns on endowment and moneyback plans? As I stared at the RM in incredulity , she continued: \"I think you should invest 1 lakh in the Ulip. Your tax saving under Section 80C will be done. Then if you have money left, invest in a mutual fund.\"Poor funds, extolled by experts as worthy to be the core of your portfolio. Meanwhile, she took out forms of the Ulip and two funds. Why these two? \"They have given more than 20% returns in the past year,\" she said.I promised to call after discussing the plan with my husband. The RM nodded and quickly moved on to the next customer . I was at the bank\\'s entrance when, on a whim, I returned to hover around her cubicle pretending to look for something. She was engrossed in her explanation to the young man, \"....the lock-in is for five years. After seven years you get the highest NAV...\"',\n",

Over two years after the scheme was first launched, not even a single apartment is ready for allotment.The Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (MMRDA), the nodal agency for the project\\'s implementation, had targeted setting up of five lakh rental homes within a span of five years. Of these, two lakh flats were to be ready within a year of the launch.While MMRDA has granted locational clearance to 39 rental housing projects, collectively accounting for 2.58 lakh flats, construction has begun in barely eight projects, making up for hardly 13,760 dwellings.Private developers and land owners were allowed to utilize a floor space index (FSI) of 4, i.e. construct up to four times the area of the plot, on the condition that they set up residential complexes comprising self-contained 160-sq ft tenements on 25% of the built-up space of their land and hand over these free-of-cost to MMRDA. The tenements, to be handed over to MMRDA in ready-to-occupy condition, would be allotted to eligible candidates for a stipulated period on leave-and-licence basis at a nominal monthly rent ranging between Rs 800 and Rs 1,500.To tap the handsome benefits on offer, top-notch developers had applied under the scheme immediately after it was announced. However, the implementation suffered setbacks following a promising start.A myriad of reasons are being given for the setbacks. A state official, overseeing the project\\'s implementation, blamed procedural delays as being a major reason. Once developers receive location clearance from MMRDA, they are required to obtain permission to initiate construction work from concerned urban local bodies (municipal corporations, City and Industrial Development Corporation, etc). \"Several projects are stuck at this stage,\" the official said.Almost all the projects taken up so far are located in remote belts in Thane, Virar and Raigad district, where property prices are far less as compared to urban areas. \"Vertical development tends to push up construction prices which, in turn, affects prices for residential apartments being sold by developers. The builders have to get the pricing right to appeal to the target segment,\" the official said. Height restrictions in some of these areas have also affected the project. A slow down in the real estate market had also hit the scheme initially.',\n",

However, since the first surveyor assessed the loss amounting to Rs 18.56 lakh and the Oriental Insurance Company only paid the textile company Rs 8.14 lakh as assessed by the second surveyor, the commission observed that the insurance company had clearly violated guidelines of the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority (IRDA).Upholding a district forum order, the commission ordered the insurance firm to pay the textile company,an additional amount ofRs 10.41 lakh along with interest of 9% per annum on Rs 18.56 lakh from June 2007 till January 2010. Further, the insurance company was also directed to pay an interest of 9% on Rs 10.41 lakh, from January 2010 till the realization of the entire amount. The textile company was also given Rs 15,000 towards the cost of litigation.Citing the IRDA guidelines the commission observed, \"The insurance company either has to settle the claim or repudiate it on receipt of the survey report. There is no provision to appoint a second surveyor.

Ashar made a spot survey and put the amount atRs 18.5 lakh and submitted his report to the insurance company.However, the firm subsequently appointed another surveyorSai Shraddha Associateswho pegged the loss at Rs 8.14 lakh. The insurance company offered this amount as a settlement to Binal Textiles. Aggrieved, the textile company filed a consumer complaint in the South Mumbai District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum on December 17, 2007.By filing its written statement, the insurance company took the stand that the first surveyor had not verified all the documents.Therefore, the insurance firm had appointed a second surveyor, who thoroughly verified the documents and submitted the verification report to the extent ofRs 8.14 lakh.At this point, the insurance company offered to pay the said amount, but the complainant had not accepted the same, which is why he filed a consumer complaint, claiming the amount as assessed by the first surveyor.Citing IRDA rules, the consumer commission said a firm can settle claim or repudiate it on receipt of a survey report, but a second survey was not permitted.',\n",

According to the latest statistics, road accident figures in Maharashtra dropped by 10% from about 72,000 in 2009 to 65,000 last year, prompting an encouraged government to launch a new road safety drive.The administration is kicking off on Monday a statewide campaign called the \"Road Safety Fortnight\" that aims to cut down the morbid numbers by a further 25% in 2011. The drive has been initiated by chief minister Prithviraj Chavan who also holds the transport portfolio.At a recent meeting with senior traffic officials and the RTO, the CM ordered round-the-clock vigil on arterial roads and highways to ensure that drivers follow traffic rules and speed limits, and that all vehicles are fitted with functional headlights, taillights, reflectors.According to statistics released by the state transport department, there were around 75,000 accidents in Maharashtra in 2008. The figures dropped to about 72,000 in 2009 and further slipped to 65,000 last year. Officials credited awareness campaigns and highway patrols for the change.

But we will try our best to keep vigil and see to it that accidents are minimised,\" Jadhav said.As part of the new initiative, Jadhav said, officers will be held accountable for accidents in their jurisdiction. \"I will make road mishaps a key parameter while conducting appraisals of RTO officers this year,\" he added. \"Officers who help prevent accidents will get special incentives.\" This will exclude accidents that are caused by natural calamities or technical faults in the vehicles.During the fortnight, the RTO will hold meetings with transporters and drivers of trucks, tempos, buses and tankers. \"Most accidents involve trucks and buses. We will ensure that their drivers are sensitised and that they maintain road discipline and speed limits while driving on highways, especially in the night,\" Jadhav said.

Men are falling prey to oral and lung cancer, particularly in the eastern parts of the country.\"The doctors have come together around the time the expert team formed by the health ministry to compile national and international reports on the ill-effects of smokeless tobacco submitted its study to the Supreme Court.A source said the team (comprising experts from the Public Health Foundation of India and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, besides the TMC) has given a damning report, a portion of which highlights how various commercial preparations of gutka and pan masala in India contain very high levels of arsenic, copper, lead, cadmium, chromium and nickel.\"These metals are capable of causing serious diseases, as they are toxic even in minute quantities,\" the report says, detailing how the consumption of smokeless tobacco also causes heart disease, reproductive problems and psychological disorders. The report, submitted on Friday, also voices concern about the popularity of gutka and pan masala among schoolchildren, calling it a huge public health issue. Activists say the developments are the high point of the war against tobacco in India. A senior surgeon from the TMH said: \"It needs to be seen whether or not the government puts human life before revenue (earned by taxing the tobacco industry).\"From a cancer survivor to an anti-tobacco crusader, it has been a life-changing journey for automobile dealer Suresh Bakshi. The journey started soon after he was diagnosed with mouth cancer. His recent brush with callous politicians in New Delhi, where he had gone to explain them the threat of smokeless tobacco, has only added to his zeal.Bakshi, who represents Voice of Victims, said: \"I still make it a point to stop at least two children every day and tell them what tobacco can do.\" Over five million children under 15 in India are addicted to gutka.Scores of cancer survivors across the country have joined Bakshi\\'s platform. One of them, part of a delegation that met leader of the opposition Sushma Swaraj and minister of state for health and family welfare Dinesh Trivedi, said: \"It is clear that the government is aware of the hazards posed by tobacco. It needs to be seen how proactive they are in banning it.\"Bakshi said: \"We (cancer survivors) have seen the worst side of tobacco consumption. We hope the government understands us better.\"',\n",
       " '58dcdedbdd8fc135205d5075': \"NEW DELHI: Continuing its gain for the third straight week, natural rubber prices on Thursday touched all time high of Rs 230 per kg on strong global cues.Prices of natural rubber, a key component for making tyres, on Thursday closed at Rs 230 per kg in Kottayam and Ernakulam, which accounts for 90% of the country's production.According to industry sources, the rally in natural rubber prices is due to the surge in prices of the commodity in the international market. Natural rubber prices in the global market touched a fresh high of Rs 250 per kg as strong demand from China and the US is fuelling the prices of the commodity.A surge in demand from the US on the back of better-than-expected growth in the automotive segment is further pushing the global prices of the commodity and the impact is also felt on the domestic market, said an expert. India's production of natural rubber in 2010 is estimated at around 8.5 lakh tonnes, whereas the total demand for natural rubber in the country is nearly 10 lakh tonnes per annum.\",\n",
       " '58dcdedddd8fc135205d5077': 'LUCKNOW: Like all other farmers in his village, Gabaddu, a 45-year-old small farmer in Magra Mau, has also planted wheat and oil seeds this winter in his 5 bigha land. He hopes to get a good yield because weather has been kind so far. But his major worry is skyrocketing prices of vegetables and pulses. \"Earlier, the village was self-sufficient as people used to grow different crops and vegetables. But now everyone follows the trend which is sure to get them good returns. As a result, farmers have to buy food grains and vegetables, other than those they have sown, from the open market. Hence, even if we get good return of our produce, the inflation nullifies it,\" said Gabaddu, who has to feed a family of nine, including a wife, parents, siblings and three children.The situation in Magra Mau reflects the macro picture of the change in the agriculture cropping pattern of UP. Of the 17 crore population in the state, more than 60% depend on agriculture with over 165 lakh hectare area under cultivation.In the past 15 years, farmers have moved towards cash crops like sugarcane, wheat, rice, potato and mustard, while turning away from pulses, coarse grains and sweet potatoes. Consequently, production of sugarcane has increased by 30%, potato 50%, oil seeds 25%, wheat 20% and rice 20% in comparison to output in mid-90s but, that of coarse grain, pulses and other crops has come down by 20%-50%. Among pulses, production of Arhar alone dropped to 3.25 lakh tonne in 2008-09 from 4.56 lakh tonne in 2001-02.The changes have been due to irrigation facilities, geographical locations, prices, nature of soil, availability of road network and storage capacity. Nearly 70% of agriculture land in UP is irrigated through tubewells, 5% through canals and remaining is rain-fed. In the Terai and west UP where irrigation facilities are adequate, farmers prefer water-intensive crops like cane and paddy. Wheat, paddy and oil seeds are more popular in central and east UP. The drought-prone Bundelkhand region depends on less water requiring crops like coarse grain and pulses. If better road network has helped farmers opt for cane and wheat as it has made transportation easier today, the availability of more cold storages has made farmers to go for perishable crops like potato.Today, farmers follow what others in their area do. \"It is easier because when everybody is on the same boat, we can depend on each other for advice. Also, it\\'s easy to find a market because traders know where they can get a particular crop in bulk,\" said Roshan, another farmer in Daheli village. \"But there is also a risk. If potato gets more price this year, all farmers in a village go for potato cultivation for the next year leading to a glut resulting in fall in prices and huge loss. Storage facilities are also not as per the demand. As a result, farmers are forced to sell produce at a loss as they need to vacate fields for the next sowing. Small and marginal farmers suffer the most,\" he said.However, a change in the cropping pattern has also made UP top producer of sugarcane, wheat, paddy and vegetable in the country. UP\\'s agri growth rate has increased from 2.10% in 10th plan to 5% in 11th five year plan, mainly due to growth in horticulture, livestock, fisheries and poultry farming.The vegetable production has also increased from 13.5 million tonne in 2000 to 15 million tonne in 2008. If Lucknow and Sultanpur have emerged as major mango exporters, Agra zone has become potato exporter, Banana is being produced at a largescale in Bahraich and mint in Barabanki. \"Agriculture productivity has increased but the change in cropping pattern has been done in an unplanned manner,\" said Prof Sudhir Kumar, president, Kisan Jagriti Manch.\"Cropping pattern should be based on the assessment of the future demand by the government. Otherwise, what happens is that in the year when there is a glut of a particular crop, farmers suffer because prices fall and when there is shortage, consumers suffer due to rise in price. But in both the conditions middlemen and traders make profit,\" he said.',\n",

It may have seemed unusual to onlookers for the player to call out his move, but then his opponent was a visually impaired boy who went on to beat Chopra in the final round of the Chennai Open chess tournament on Wednesday.The lanky, 16-year-old Darpan Inani, wearing blue glasses, rose to his feet and felt the chessboard to close out the game, and his mother, sitting beside to help him make the moves, could barely conceal her delight.Darpan had set the record for being the youngest to win the National blind chess championships in Mumbai in July last year. The Baroda-based lad was also the youngest to represent India in the World Blind Chess Championship in Serbia. The win at the Chennai Open, in a field of 300 players, showed Inani could hold his own against any kind of competition despite his handicap.He is the only blind player in the fray. And it is easy to spot his table -- three people around it and quite a few others looking on. \"It is easy to sit back and blame my condition,\" Inani told TOI after the win. \"The challenge is to test myself against normal players, so that I can be considered normal.\"Inani was afflicted by the Steven Johnson Syndrome (allergic reaction to medicine in his case) and lost his vision completely before he turned four. His father Satish, a businessman and mother Vimla agonised over the career choices their son could make. \"We wanted him to take up some activity where his lack of sight would not be a handicap or hindrance and hence opted for chess where the visually impaired could compete with those more fortunate, on equal terms,\" Vimla said.Inani relies on his opponents calling out their moves during the match and that helps him. He feels the board to know where the pieces are. That courtesy can be withdrawn in tight situations though. \"During the endgames, my opponents do not call out their moves. And I have to ask them and only then do they oblige,\" he said.That is where his mother comes into the equation. Vimla, who admits her knowledge of chess is very limited, sits next to her son writing down the notations and tells him in case the opponent is staying silent.The 11th standard student is coached by Mumbai-based International Master Shekhar Sahu, who periodically visits him or lends assistance over the telephone. \"His immense talent could make him a world champion and the next couple of years will be crucial - how he shapes up and whether he can attract sponsors,\" said Sahu.One of Inani\\'s most cherished moments came after his win in the National blind chess championship when he got to meet his idol Viswanathan Anand. The world champion had praised him for his ability to analyze his games, which, Anand reckoned, would stand him in good stead over the years. Inani juggles with both studies and chess but it is the former that he values more. \"I would like to go on and become a chartered accountant. I have not thought about pursuing chess as a career seriously,\" he said.',\n",

I answer them and post information that may be of interest to the visitors. Other officers, too, keep track and post their comments there,\" Joshi added. She said that Facebook is being increasingly accessed by the youth and the upwardly mobile section of the society, and it was deemed necessary to reach out to them. \"The census page attempts to take away the indifference among people and make them understand why it is so important to be counted.

This shortage of police personnel is leading to increasing number of accidents on the city roads. We don't even have enough people to guard the major traffic intersections, said a senior traffic cop.For a busy intersection like Rajiv Chowk, nearly 10-15 constables are needed to manage it properly.

Already there is a significant decrease in use of p l a s t i c c a r r y b a g s , said Malhotra. There are many who feel that the move helps big corporate houses. National president of Confederation of All Indian Traders B C Bhartiya said it would kill the traditional retailer who sells products at nominal profit. He alleged that big corporate houses and MNCs were seeking help of legislation and making smooth business impossible for small retailers and hawkers.\"In the name of environment they are making business difficult for people. How can you insist a person charge for an item that he wants to give for free,\" he said. A grocery shop owner Ramesh Sahu pointed out it was difficult for small traders to charge for carry bags. \"In fact, we cannot also use ecofriendly bags.We need to pack the very small quantities separately. Customers get annoyed if we pack the stuff in paper,\" said Sahu. Many times, customers walk away if vendors refuse to give them a bag for free. There are a few shop owners and shoppers, though, who are happy with new rules.Deepak Sharma, a grocery shop owner in Itwari, said, \"when the ban was imposed, initially we were very firm and our customers responded well. Now, about 60 % bring their own bags. We still face difficulty in dealing with the rest.\" Neeta Rawal, homemaker and a resident of Wardhaman Nagar, said she and her mother-in-law Kanan always believed in eco-friendly shopping. On Wednesday they shopped at a mall in Wardhaman Nagar area. They carried their own bags to the mall to get the stuff in.',\n",

She immediately took out the bottle and swallowed the poison. Before I could snatch the bottle from her, she had gulped down around three-fourths of the bottle,\" said Ravi.Rutuja then tried to convince Ravi that she had bought less-powerful poison. \"She told me that nothing is happening to her and asked me to walk along with her till her house.

He asked all federations to register themselves with the ministry if they wanted grants/financial help from the government. The federations were asked to furnish audited balance sheets. They were also told to hold their elections in a transparent manner, in keeping with the guidelines of the Election Commission. This left the federation officials  including BCCI bosses -- frothing at their mouths.The other directive, to put a cap on the age and tenure of these officials, again in keeping with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) guidelines, met with severe resistance, strangely even from the IOC who kept threatening India with suspension.Gill\\'s tenure also threw up another controversial decision - only India passport holders could represent the country in the international arena. \"We should promote homegrown talent. If they want to play for India they should be Indian citizens.\" This generated quite a bit of heat but the protests soon lost steam.It was towards the end of 2010 that Gill himself felt the heat - of the Commonwealth Games. The controversies in the run-up to the Games did not leave him unscarred, even though the delays and majority of the goof-ups were the doing of other agencies and departments. He was one of the prominent faces of the Games and some blame came at his door too.Is that the reason he has been shunted out?

As a result, farmers suffered huge losses as mills refused to buy the crop. The government had to procure wheat to compensate for the losses.Wheat requires moderate temperatures (maximum 20-23 degrees Celsius and minimum 4-5 degrees Celsius) during sowing season and light rains in January for growth. High temperature and no rains lead to improper growth of the crop, early ripening and damages formation of grain. Wheat that was planted in November is presently in the milking stage while the one planted in December is in the flowering stage. The present weather conditions may damage the wheat in both the conditions.This year, till January 13, the maximum temperatures were around 15 degrees Celsius. But for the past one week, the maximum temperatures have been above 25 degrees Celsius, 2-5 degrees above normal. \"If warm weather conditions continued for 10-15 days, it might cause severe damage to wheat. The heat will shrivel the grains of wheat in the milking stage and affect the growth of the wheat planted in December,\" said president, Kisan Jagriti Manch, Sudhir Kumar.UP is the largest wheat producer in India, providing 35% to food basket. This year the target of wheat production is over 300 lakh tonnes. During 2009 and 2008, wheat production in the state stood at 275 lakh tonnes and 255 lakh tonnes respectively. At many places in east UP, wheat was sown in November which, at present, is in the milking stage. But in west UP, farmers sowed wheat late due to delay in disposal of sugarcane, hence the crop is still in the early stage.',\n",

And it\\'s just three days since the first invite was sent out.But is Google+ very different from Facebook? Can it kill Facebook? \"Time has shown that social networks don\\'t last for very long. People move in large numbers to one network and then leave for another after some time. So Google is trying again and again,\" says Asheesh Raina, principal research analyst with Gartner.Jatin Kumar, a social networking junkie, remembers those days of multiple competing social networks. \"Friendster, Orkut, Hi5, MySpace and a host of other services came up at that point. But today there is only one dominant social network and that is Facebook.\"The first impressions of Google+, currently under limited testing, point to an integration of a host of Google services with a social networking layer, with many features in common with Facebook, but a killer feature called \\'Hangout\\'.After logging in, you are greeted by the familiar Google colours and simplistic interface that people have come to expect from Google. The steady updates are shown on \\'Stream\\', equivalent to Facebook\\'s \\'Wall\\'.The \\'Like\\' function is performed by \\'+1\\' in Google+. It is also integrated with Google search results so you can directly \\'+1\\' a search result and it will be recommended to your friends.Talking about friend circles, Google+\\'s Circles are quite similar to friend groups on Facebook. You categorize your friends in \\'Circles\\' like friends, family, work and acquaintances by dragging and dropping them in big coloured circles going by these names. Google has made the categorization process much more graphical and intuitive, trying to gain advantage over Facebook which was sometimes criticised for the difficulty of separating friend groups and setting privacy settings. So when sharing content you can just choose the circles you want to share it with.Such similarity in features between Facebook and Google+ prompted some people on Google+ to comment that it\\'s just Google playing \\'copycat\\' while some others took an instant liking to it. \"I am in love with Google+. It\\'s going to be a hit unlike Buzz and Wave,\" says an analyst working with an auditing firm in Hyderabad.

However, some complained of significant video lag. \"It\\'s not anywhere close to Skype but it\\'s good,\" said Sriram M, a media professional in Bangalore, who hung out at Google+. Sparks, on the other hand, lets you choose your interest topics and feeds you with relevant information on those to keep you busy on Google+.Apart from these features, all the regular Google services like Chat, Documents, Reader, Gmail, among others are integrated with Google+. Signing in with your Google ID gives you access to everything.The best part: If you don\\'t like Google+ and want to exit, the network allows you to download your complete profiles onto their computers in zip format. And exit.Many analysts believe these features may give Google an edge in the enterprise space, where the trend of local social networks for collaboration is gaining ground. \"With this complete offering, Google is in a better position.

The report said advance payment to SIS Live was hiked from 30% to 60% days before the Games despite the ministry\\'s reservations. It has charged Lalli and Doordarshan director general Aruna Sharma for causing a loss of Rs 135 crore.The report gives credence to I&B ministry\\'s misgivings about the broadcast deal awarded to the UK broadcaster. SIS Live\\'s clout with Prasar Bharati is evident in the major deviations that took place in the draft contract between October 2010 and March 2011. This was in violation of Central Vigilance Commission norms.The changes agreed to by Prasar Bharati included changes in terms of payments, performance guarantee, liquidated damages and duties and liabilities of Prasar Bharati and SIS Live as well as sub-contracting. Some of these demands were made by other entities shortlisted but were summarily rejected by Prasar Bharati.The report said, \"Most of these changes were heavily loaded against the interests of Prasar Bharati and diluted the liabilities and obligations of SIS Live.\" This was done despite I&B ministry pointing out amendments to the contract would leave the field open for legal intervention by other parties who had lost the bid.The committee found the public broadcaster ignored the ministry\\'s advice to conduct price comparisons and verification of services and was willing to pay exorbitant rates for production and coverage of the Games. All this was compounded by procedural delays.The report said, \"Ministry and finance wing of Prasar Bharati had expressed concerns and questioned the propriety of awarding contracts under defective and vitiated procedures adopted on a number of occasions. These concerns were brushed aside by PB and DD on the grounds of criticality of time.\"The report said failure to assess risks led to a major fallout in that \"SIS Live threatened to walk out or refused to carry out work on a number of occasions and, thus, with the help of some top elements in management, coerced Prasar Bharati and ministry into taking decisions in its favour\".

In schools wanting affiliation to CBSE/CISEC, the medium of instruction should be Kannada or mother tongue of the child between Classes 1 to 5. Even after getting affiliation to central boards, the school should compulsorily teach Kannada as a subject.While seeking NOC from the primary and secondary education department, schools must give an undertaking that the admission to pre-primary classes will be done only in April. During fee revision, they must consult parents, and there's no room for mid-session hikes. The draft rules are in the public domain and schools and parents can air their views. It's the first time the government has framed rules for granting NOCs to schools seeking affiliation to other boards.While starting pre-primary schools, the management has to obtain prior permission according to the Karnataka Educational Institutions (Classification and Registration) Rules, 1997.

Immediately after the market learnt of CoS decision, cotton prices that were touching an all-time high of Rs 7000 a quintal in mandis of Vidarbha, started sliding.\"The rates fell by at least Rs 300 a quintal in the domestic market on Friday.

       " '58dce78ddd8fc135f3ea60b7': 'NEW DELHI: Refusal of successive regimes at the Centre to wean the rural constituency away from kerosene is perpetuating diversion of the poor man\\'s fuel and has given rise to countrywide adulteration mafia with cross-border links.While central subsidy gives kerosene a price advantage over other fuels, state control over its distribution leads to creation of vested interests at the grassroots level. The two factors combine to make monitoring against diversion difficult.The widening gap between the fuel\\'s government price at home and neighbouring countries has added an international dimension to the adulteration racket. Substantial quantities are now being smuggled to Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan.The Centre at present decides how much kerosene is to be supplied in a state. This is done through a process involving the Planning Commission, the oil ministry and the state government. After the quantity is decided, the oil companies hand over the fuel to state authorities at their depots.The fuel is then handled by state officials and ration shop dealers. It is well-known that both collude to exploit loopholes in the public distribution system and manipulate figures to divert the subsidised product.The Centre\\'s plan to introduce a marker  hidden chemical in kerosene that shows up in tests if used to adulterate motor fuels  too faltered after complaints were filed with the CBI over a pilot project. The pilot was being carried out with a non-toxic proprietary marker from a US-based global major. The CBI had last year given a clean chit to the programme but the oil ministry is still dragging its feet on the issue.Such government attitudes stand out starkly against studies by National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) and National Institute of Public Finance and Planning (NIPFP). Both have pointed to failures of the subsidy policy and instead favoured steps to plug leakage and ways (like special cards in food scheme) to ensure the benefit reaches the target.The NIPFP study, for example, said kerosene and cooking gas subsidies benefit semi-urban and urban consumers more, respectively, rather than the rural poor. \"Decades of subsidies have failed to shift the fuel consumption patterns away from biomass in rural areas,\" it said.',\n",

Authorities in Gurgaon are now mulling over introducing a similar fee to develop the much needed parking infrastructure in the city.Officials in Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon feel the need to have a similar charge. The reason MCD has cited to increase the fee is to make parking lots for the ever increasing vehicles. We have a similar problem here. Moreover, there is so much congestion on the roads and the infrastructure is crumbling. Imposing a fee like night parking charge is a good option. Its a one time charge and should not pinch the residents much, said an MCG official. Local transport department officials say that as of now there is no such plan in place. We dont levy any night parking fee as of now and there is no such proposal at present. Even if there is one it has to be initiated at the state level and the transport department will decide how much it should be, said Satender Duhan, SDM Gurgaon (north), who is the registering authority for vehicles in the city. For using MCD roads and parking spaces, Delhiites have to pay a one-time night parking charge to the municipal corporation while registering the vehicle. People often park vehicles outside their homes or on roads and other public places which belongs to MCD. They have to pay for using MCD land for parking,\" an MCG official had said.But residents have protested any extra charge. Look at the roads. They are all broken and full of potholes, we are already paying so much money in terms of taxes and I dont see any reason for such a fee.

In the past two months, cash-strapped developers have flocked to private money lenders who provide short-term loans at exorbitant interest rates of between 24% and 30% a year. Banks charge builders between 13% and 15% interest a year.Market sources said leading banks now lend to only credible builders for select projects, but have turned off the tap for most others in the construction sector. \"They are busy mopping up what is due to them. By March 2011, Mumbai builders alone are scheduled to return roughly Rs 6,000 crore to banks,\" said the CEO of a leading property fund. Market sources said some leading developers in Mumbai have loan exposures of Rs 3,000-4,000 crore each.A south Mumbai builder is believed to have approached a Kutchi investor last month when a public sector bank refused to reschedule his loan. TOI has learnt that the investor charged the builder 36% interest. The builder also had to mortgage his Nepean Sea Road property. The RBI directed lending institutions to limit their exposure to real estate after the LIC Housing scam last November. Bankers said that most of the loans to builders have to be repaid before the end of March, before banks close their books. This is because lenders do not want their balance sheet to reveal their exposure to real estate, which RBI considers a sensitive sector.Investigating agencies arrested senior officials of public sector banks on charges of pushing loans to construction companies in return for monetary benefits. Bank officials and executives of a financial services firm worked in tandem to provide loans and other facilities to real estate players.In mid-2008, when financial institutions and banks restricted loans to developers during the global meltdown, moneylenders primarily belonging to the Sindhi, Marwari and Kutchi communities stepped in. A suburban developer said these moneylenders are back because banks have halved their funding in the past one month. However, he added that the liquidity crunch was a temporary phenomenon, which would last for another three to six months. Builders are also raising short-term money from private equity funds which are extending loans at over 20% to top builders.Mumbai-based developer Wadhwa Group\\'s Vijay Wadhwa said banks have stopped disbursement to second-rung builders.\"Banks are flush with funds, but they want to give it to the right people.

They also revealed that very simple behavioural changes would go a long way in preventing many a health hazard.Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) specialist of Unicef Gregor Meerganz von Medeazza insists that the simple practice of washing hands with soap at regular intervals has its obvious benefits in preventing various diseases. He believes that the people are aware of the simple habits they should be following but rarely put them into any use.United Nations Children\\'s Fund (Unicef) has done a lot in this regard, building around 16 water treatment plants with the help of Neeri in Madhya Pradesh over the last year. The organisation runs programmes in schools to inculcate the basic values of hygiene and sanitation among the rural kids.Another major cause of concern for them is the widespread open defecation prevalent in the country, which they say is an open invitation to diseases. Human waste gets mixed with groundwater, thus becoming the cause of various water borne diseases. \"So, the water borne diseases are in actuality sanitation borne diseases,\" exclaimed Gregor.M K C Sridhar, who has more than 18 years\\' experience of working towards providing better sanitation to Nigerians, concurred. He said very simple techniques like pot chlorination, coagulation and filtration could be used even at homes. He stated that recycling and reusing water is not as complex as it sounds, all one has to make sure is that organic matter is properly removed from used water.\"It is good to see that people are willing to reuse water, but they often do so without treating it. It\\'s not enough to physically clean water but what is more important is removal of toxins. This happens when the waste organic matter is allowed to decompose aerobically, instead of letting it flow onto stagnant pools. In fact, this organic waste can even be used as compost,\" he said.

This would be subject to incremental steps towards fiscal consolidation which means that the government would need to spend within its means.\"The diversified structure of India\\'s approximately $1.7 trillion economy, its robust growth over the past decade and its strong growth outlook constitute key sovereign credit strengths....We expect that this acceleration (in long-term GDP growth) will endure over the medium term, thanks to high savings and investment rates, beneficial demographic trends, strengthening corporate competitiveness, and a generally growth-enhancing policy stance,\" said Moody\\'s in its credit analysis of India.Moody\\'s said that it expects GDP growth of 7.5 to 8% in 2011-12, and for inflation to abate slowly over the course of the year to about 7%. \"Given current global uncertainty, and the continuing transmission of the RBI\\'s tightening over the last year, the risks to both forecasts are on the downside.

It also said that inflationary pressures, and poor social and physical infrastructure posed a threat to growth.Moody\\'s said that so far the government\\'s foreign debt had a higher rating of \\'Baa3\\' as it felt that the government would prioritize foreign debt over domestic.\"The authorities\\' recent efforts to deepen the domestic bond market suggest that they are increasingly unlikely to prioritize external obligations over domestic as that would destabilize the domestic markets they are trying to strengthen. Therefore, and as reflected in the positive outlook on the Ba1 rating, Moody\\'s would consider unifying India\\'s local and foreign currency ratings at Baa3 upon ascertaining that continued growth and incremental steps towards fiscal consolidation would improve domestic debt sustainability and that a commitment to strengthening the domestic bond market eliminates the likelihood of the government prioritizing external over domestic obligations.\"',\n",

Most of the elders and youngsters, especially women and girls, are still illiterate. We are just trying to dispel the darkness of ignorance from their mind,\" Tabassum told TOI on Wednesday.\"We went door-to door to convince the parents to send their children to the madrassa, and we are happy to see the results. Presently, over 100 kids are getting elementary education in this madrassa,\" she added.The madrassa - Ansar-ul-Ulum - is situated in the Muslim pocket of Sajoi village. It was closed about 17 years ago. The main reason of the closure was that the parents, mostly weavers, could not afford to send their children to the madrassa due to the slump in the silk industry, said Mustkim, a local native, who looks after the madrassa after its reopening.Tabassum, Tarannum and Rubina not only teach the kids at madrassa but have also joined a cutting and tailoring course being run under the MEGA-SKY (minority education for growth and advancement skills for youth) project supported by USAID and Education Development Centre (EDC), New Delhi.In Varanasi, the project is being implemented by the Human Welfare Association (HWA).Sajoi village, according to Mustakim, has a population of about 15,000 including 3,500 Muslims weavers.There is one government primary school in the village. But majority of the Muslim boys and girls are away from the mainstream education. Earlier, only religious education was imparted at this madrassa, but today, under this project, general elementary education is also being imparted to the children, Mustakim said, adding that awareness regarding the importance of education is increasing in the community.The project coordinator, Sunil Kumar, told TOI that the girls could start working after undergoing the six-month tailoring and cutting course.Currently, 20 girls are getting training at the centre known as Tarakkin Centre.According to him, five such centres are also being run in other Muslim-dominated areas like Benipur, Kurauna, Harsos and Deendaspur.HWA director Rajni Kant said that Muslim community, which stands second in population, is unable to participate in welfare programmes like education, health, family welfare and community development due to illiteracy.The HWA is trying to increase the enrolment in madrassas and schools, he said, adding that the traditional handloom weavers produce the best quality products but unfortunately they don\\'t getting even 10% return on their goods.

The act of vengeance was witnessed at Shivpur Beldaur village under Pauara police outpost in Khagaria district on Tuesday night.Police said Runa Devi, the second wife of one, Jagdish Singh, gave her three stepdaughters murhi with milk to eat not before clandestinely mixing the food with strong dose of pesticide kept in the house. After consuming the poison-laced food, two of the girls Saraswati (7) and Lakshmi (5) died immediately. However, Shweta (3), the youngest of the three sisters, could withstand the heavy dose of poison for some time and was rushed to the nearby Sonbersa primary health centre (PHC) where she is battling for life.Meanwhile, the incident led the other family members and villagers aware of the evil motives of Runa who was soon taken into custody only to call the police on the spot. Runa reportedly later told police that she resorted to the extreme step only to settle a score after being humiliated by her husband's first wife, who allegedly beat her after their children had a quarrel during play at home on Tuesday.Khagaria SP Sudhanshu Kumar on Wednesday said the woman had been arrested and the food given to the children to eat had also been seized which would be sent for forensic test. The SP said the husband of the two women, Jagdish, works as a labourer in Punjab, adding the woman's reaction was the result of a fallout of a feud in the family.\",\n",

But as he says, \"The will of the highest authorities is crucial.\" Currently an assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University, Mukherjee studied in St Columba\\'s School before becoming a Rhodes scholar. With degrees from Stanford University, Oxford and Harvard Medical School, he feels sad when somebody refers to effective and affordable cancer prevention and care as synonymous with the first world.\"There are perfectly achievable goals in cancer treatment for all countries including India. Cervical cancer is initiated by a virus and is a completely preventable disease by vaccination and changes in sexual practice, which is highly achievable in India. Minimizing tobacco use will cut down lung cancer cases while routine mammography can diagnose and treat breast cancer early. None of these prevention mechanisms are complicated. The will of larger authorities is crucial,\" Mukherjee says.But why is India suddenly reporting such a massive spurt in cancer cases -- 10 lakh new patients every year and four lakh deaths?\"Ageing of course. Also, early and accurate diagnosis is helping attribute the exact cause of death that didn\\'t happen before. Environmental carcinogens too are playing a major role. Increase in tobacco smoking is another major determinant,\" says Mukherjee.Calling cancer the next big frontier of medicine, Mukherjee explains cancer is not one disease but many diseases that share a common biological principle -- a cell that has lost control and is dividing abnormally. \"Ultimately it\\'s a gene that lives inside us unlike a virus. The challenge, therefore, is how to kill the cancer cells while sparing the normal cells before the former invades the organs and destroys their function.\"Admitting a kind of nihilism that has risen around cancer in India upsets him, Mukherjee adds, \"The oncologists here are exceptional. Visiting AIIMS is a moving experience. The kind of work being done in a place that does not have much resources to start with is unbelievable. The volume of patients is enormous despite which doctors show so such compassion. Surgeons operating in less than ideal circumstances and yet being able to deliver is very impressive. So there is no lack of committed medical staff. What is required are some alterations in policy.\"Mukherjee\\'s book, which took six years to write, documents eloquently a disease humans have lived with -- and perished from -- for more than 5,000 years. From the Persian Queen Atossa, whose Greek slave cut off her malignant breast, to the 19th century recipient of primitive radiation and chemotherapy and Mukherjee\\'s own leukemia patient, Carla, \"The Emperor of All Maladies\" is about the people who have soldiered through toxic, bruising and draining regimes to survive and to increase the store of human knowledge.So, what is his next work going to be on? \"Culture and history through the eye of medicine maybe,\" Mukherjee concludes.',\n",

The two departments at the Centre have taken up the long-pending issue of liberating bamboo from the clutches of the ministry of environment and the forest (MoEF).For nearly a decade, Goswami has been fighting for the cause. Reacting to the latest development of some sections of the government seeking releasing of bamboo from the control of the forest department, he said it was a welcome move. \"It shows awareness about the economic importance of bamboo and the potential it holds by way of employment generation, is increasing. A new sector that has been totally ignored despite India\\'s natural advantages is waiting to be explored,\" said Goswami.Slamming the forest bureaucracy for its reluctance to free bamboo from its control, he hoped sanity would prevail and it would take the sage advice of other ministries of the government. \"After China, India is the biggest producer of bamboo. But while the bamboo business is booming in that country, stringent restrictions on cutting and transport even in private plantations is stifling the bamboo industry in India,\" said Goswami.\"I am also examining the legal recourse and have recently filed a public interest litigation which should come up in the high court here anytime,\" the bamboo technologist informed.\"In fact the bamboo control policy of the MoEF is totally anti-conservation. Allowing bamboo in private plantations without any restrictions would reduce the pressure of forest grown bamboo which they can zealously guard using the department\\'s manpower. Bamboo which regenerates fast and has a life-cycle of 50 years can reduce dependence on distress-hit traditional crops like cotton in Vidarbha.\"Once it is free, the bamboo industry at the village level can create millions of jobs across the country, especially with new technology providing varied use. It can be processed into timber for construction and furniture along with other traditional uses in handicraft and items of household use. Thus bamboo can lead to protecting forests as felling for timber can be reduced,\" explained Goswami.Once the new technology is adapted to Indian conditions, bamboo can emerge as a major revenue earner and boost the Indian economy. \"We have seen it happen in China. Its time India takes the right steps in that direction,\" said Goswami. He said restrictions imposed on it are a big hurdle. \"Recently we went through a nightmare while starting a bamboo processing unit near Ramtek. The forest officials are reluctant to co-operate and banks also shy from funding any new enterprise. What is difficult to understand is that while MoEF is so negative on bamboo\\'s public use, the Centre has been promoting its use by setting up the National Bamboo Mission and Mission on Bamboo Applications,\" remarked Goswami.',\n",

However, the CNG operators may also be forced to revise the prices due to immense pressure to buy expensive imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) to meet the growing demand in the absence of allocation from domestic fields.Official sources said the city gas distributors (CGDs) such as Gujarat Adani Energy Limited (GAEL), Gujarat Gas Company Limited (GGCL) and Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) get a fraction of natural gas from the domestic fields. They mostly have to rely on the expensive imported LNG to meet the consumer demand across the state.In Delhi, the Indraprastha Gas Limited (IGL), which has been forced to buy expensive imported LNG in the absence of allocation from domestic fields, is planning to increase the CNG prices by Rs 4 per kilogram this year. The company had increased CNG prices by Rs 1.25 per kilogram in the first week of January.The country\\'s gas utilisation policy does not give higher priority to city gas distributors (CGDs) in Gujarat for award of affordable gas from the domestic fields; instead the CGDs are forced to rely on LNG supply to meet the growing demands of their customers.

The total gas exploration in India is just over 140 million metric standard cubic metre per day (mmscmd) meeting barely half the demand and the remaining supply deficit is met by imported LNG.\"The imported LNG costs anything between $8 and $10 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) as against $4.2 per mmBtu price, at which the gas from the state-run fields and Reliance is available. There is a huge demand for CNG in the state after the hike in petrol prices,\" said a source from the CGD sector.Authorised dealers and retro-fitters of CNG kits said there is a two-fold increase in the customers wanting to convert their petrol cars into CNG. The demand for CNG will increase further across the state.\"The CNG costs between Rs 32 and Rs 35 per kilogram in Gujarat. If a comparison is done between the vehicles running on petrol and CNG, the daily operating cost for an average running of 35 kilometres for CNG comes at Rs 54 against Rs145 for the petrol vehicle.

There were no seizures from the family of promoters Jayaswals' in Nagpur so far, said a source in the department.Meanwhile, a senior official of the Group said that the raid concluded on Wednesday with the computer server seized and a back-up of the data also being taken away. The raid covered even the independent directors of the company apart from promoters.Apart from the seizure, the probe will continue on the alleged practice of bringing in unaccounted money as capital into the business, said source. The 24 companies found to have provided capital to the Abhijeet Group are from Kolkata. The tax sleuths are finding these transactions to be dubious because entities did not have any explainable source of income so as to be able to provide so much capital.The process continued for almost 2-3 years with Abhijeet Group garnering capital to the tune of Rs 8,000 crore estimate the tax sleuths. However, I-T sleuths think a large part of it could also be mere book entries with funds actually not moving.Kolkata is a major centre for such deals, sources said. Offering services for arranging accounting entries to show capital infusion is a widespread business in this city. It involves several persons like chartered accountants, individuals having unaccounted money, and persons who lend their name for opening bank accounts to cart such wealth, said a source.It is an intricate process in which money flows through the banking channel but from a fictitious business entity. This gives an impression that legitimate wealth had entered a business but it is not so. Money comes through almost 6-7 layers starting with cash being deposited into a benami account. It then starts travelling to different destinations through cheque before finally landing at the last stop. Using several layers helps in fudging the trail.However, often the company which takes the money by cheque pays back the amount in cash along with a service charge of around 5%. This leads to squaring off and no fresh money reaches the business while the book entries indicate otherwise. This is suspected to have happened in Abhijeet Group case, said sources.\",\n",

A litre of kerosene sold at ration shops is often costlier than a bottle of packaged water. Most of this \"poor man\\'s fuel\" is pilfered and sold in the black market for a price that\\'s two or three times higher.It\\'s really money for jam. Sonawane tried to meddle with this lucrative illegality and paid with his life. Actually, most enforcement officers make peace with the fuel mafia and get some crumbs from the mafia. It would appear Sonawane didn\\'t.The oil ministry has tried to work out the maths of this black market. According to its estimates  said to be conservative  as much as 40% of the kerosene supplied for the poor is siphoned off by \"organized gangs of mafia proportion\". But even going by this estimate, the illegal trade is humungous.Here\\'s a quick calculation. State-run oil companies annually supply 9-10 million tonne of the fuel for sale through ration shops; 40% of that means almost 4 million tonne  or about 5200,000,000 litres of kerosene  is flowing into the parallel market. At around Rs 31 per litre in the open market, this trade is worth Rs 16,120 crore. That\\'s why the official estimate (done in 2006) is said to be conservative.\"Even at the government-capped price, the value of this diverted kerosene will be huge. Add to that the money these fuel gangs would be making by selling it in the black market for more than twice the controlled price, and you will get a really large trade involving thousands of people,\" said a senior marketing executive of biggest fuel retailer IndianOil Corporation said.An interim report by National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) had in 2005-06 said nearly 4-5 million kilolitres of kerosene was being diverted every year. It had put the stakes at Rs 10,000 crore at the time when consumption levels were hovering a tad higher at 10-11 million tonne a year.Around the same time, a study by National Institute of Public Finance and Planning (NIPFP) said government subsidy gave kerosene an undue price advantage against other fuels and created ground for diversion. The NIPFP study also said kerosene and cooking gas subsidies benefit semi-urban and urban consumers more, respectively, rather than the rural poor. \"Decades of subsidies have failed to shift the fuel consumption patterns away from biomass in rural areas.\"Oil company executives said about 20% of the total kerosene supplied to the ration shops are used for adulteration of diesel and lubricants used by truckers. Now a substantial quantity is smuggled to Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan as the fuel is priced much higher in those countries. \"When the studies were being conducted, kerosene was even being smuggled to Sri Lanka. But it may not be the case now,\" the IOC executive said.Oil company executives say that about a third of the diverted kerosene is used as fuel (no doubt, by the poor at a hefty premium). The remaining quantity is used for adulteration or is smuggled out of the country. Usually adulteration with diesel is done in the ratio of 30:70 but in cases it can go upto almost half. \"It all depends on how quick a buck the adulterator wants to make or on the diesel supply position,\" one executive said.',\n",

       " '58dcedbfdd8fc135f3ea628c': 'GURGAON: Despite abundant supply, commercial and office spaces on Sohna Road are far from occupied. Experts say that developers have to throw some fringe benefits other than just pricing discounts to attract potential tenants. Added to this, a poor infrastructure in the area like the absence of schools, bad roads and heavy truck traffic, it might take some time for the area to gain popularity.Sahel Pramendra, managing director (Transaction Management Services) Jones Lang LaSalle India, explained: Compared to the demand, there is more supply of both commercial and office spaces on Sohna Road. However, there is no substantial demand in the whole of Gurgaon at present and hence this will be a deciding factor in the next six to nine months as to whether prices will stabilise or move up. Also, due to this gap in supply and demand, anchor tenants would command a discount.Real estate analysts feel that with the quantum of supply and a stagnant demand, the developer needs to go the extra mile to offer things like rent free periods; create environment and lower maintenance to attract tenants/buyers.Dr Sanjay Sharma of QuBREX added: In terms of residential options, there is pretty high occupancy. However, neither are the malls nor office spaces doing well there. No premium brand has settled there in terms of retail space. Even the vacancy in terms of office space is mind-boggling as a trip in the evening will show. Further, the Metro has not yet reached Sohna Road to be able to attract a lot of office-goers.Also, since there is huge space (almost two million sq-feet) it is hard to imagine the prices or rents going sky-high, especially as there are many other options available in Gurgaon at alternative locations, that too at reasonable rates, felt experts.Ramesh Menon, director portal of Delhi-masterplan.com, averred: With Delhi throwing up almost 25,000 hectares of developable land in 2011, along with progressive policies, areas farther from Delhi wouldnt remain that attractive. With favourable land pricing, the Delhi opportunity is likely to eclipse parts of Gurgaon drastically.Also, since Sohna Road has been developed by multiple developers, it lacks cohesion of master planning. It has not evolved in character as a sub-city with the concept of walk-to-work.Though every development has adhered to their project level density norms, at the sub-city level, the entire stretch seems inconsonant to the other developed areas of Gurgaon.Both inter-city as well as intra-city transportation is a challenge for Sohna Road residents, with an additional expense incurred towards connecting with the Metro. The distance from the airport, railway station, Metro and other recreational places too are a deterrent. The physicaland social infrastructure in proportion to the density of dwelling units is not up to the mark on Sohna Road, which deters corporate houses from mooting the idea of shifting internally to their employees, added Ruchika Bhardwaj, lead analyst of Certes Realty Ltd.This is also evident with several developers switching their projects midway from retail to office spaces. The commercial real estate has recorded a consistent annual appreciation of 25 to 30% in the past several years in this area. The future perceives huge real estate growth in residential as well as commercial sectors of Sohna Road, said an Omaxe spokesperson.Added Ravi Saund, head-Business Development, CHD Developers Ltd: Commercial real estate can be divided into two office space and retail.

       " '58dcedd1dd8fc135f3ea6292': 'MUMBAI: On the last day of last year, the city lost Zul Velani. It was kept private. Had it become known that we had lost the voice, honeyed and baritone, of 731 Films Division documentaries and countless newsreels, Zul\\'s way to his rest might have been mobbed. His commentaries and scripts ruled in the era when theatres were obliged to screen an FD film before every feature film.It is appropriate that he left quietly. It was the way he handled his exits, a notable difference from his entrances. The reference to Theatre is intentional because he was, beginning to end, a man of the Theatre, onstage as in life. He could not help the drama of his entrances, fine drawn as he was of feature and frame, golden voiced, elegant of hand and gesture, floppy hair not cultivated but such was its effect.Zul Velani was numerously talented. He wrote elegantly, spoke for film and radio in English and Hindi, acted and directed for stage and screen. His debut in Bombay as an actor was in Bernard Shaw\\'s Arms and the Man. He played the role that became the Chocolate Soldier in an operetta of the same name and that\\'s what he was, sweet-natured, with a charm that won you over as swiftly as chocolate. Yet he was the soldier. Born and raised in East Africa, he was easily roused against injustice and never forgot the colonial iniquities in the land of his birth, ending up by writing The Flaming Spear, based on the story of Jomo Kenyatta, Father of Free Kenya.He directed and played Iago in a memorable production of Othello, two performances of which were ruined, the first by rain and the second by a power failure. In the latter, he went on stage with a flaming torch to apologize and the audience didn\\'t move, thinking it was all part of the play.But it was in Films Division that Zul ruled for nigh on 40 years and not just as commentary writer and voice. Once Prem Vaidya, one of FD\\'s finest cameramen-directors, was assigned a film on the aboriginals of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The resulting footage was rejected by the elders of FD. But Zul saw it. He wrote a commentary to which the film was edited. It won several national and international awards. There is a long-playing record of Lata Mangeshkar with Dnayneshwar on one side and two chapters of the Bhagwad Gita on the other, read by Zul Velani.There is a moment in Shaw\\'s Candida that comes to mind. Zul played Marchbanks, a youthful poet, in Alyque Padamsee\\'s production of it. Candida asks, \"How old are you, Marchbanks?\" The young man replies, \"In a hundred years, we shall both be the same age. I must go now, the night outside grows impatient.\" The curtain comes down.',\n",

Stress at work and in social life has resulted in an increase in the number of people suffering from psychiatric illnesses and sub-syndromes of diseases like headache, tension and insomnia, says a survey conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on urban mental health.According to the survey conducted across three cities in the country, including Delhi, 8-10% people suffer from psychiatric illnesses like depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia, among others.Sub-syndrome mental illnesses - psychological problems that do not qualify as mental illness - were found to be more common. \"Total 3,600 people in Delhi from different socio-economic strata were included in this study, which was conducted between 2004 and 2009. It was found that even in a city like Delhi, where medical facilities are available and there is greater awareness about psychiatric illnesses, only 10-20% receive treatment. There is a stigma attached to mental illness and people tend to avoid institutional health facilities available,\" said Dr Nimesh Desai, director of the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences (IHBAS), who led the urban mental health survey in Delhi. He said focus group meetings conducted to analyse the results showed that many people - mostly young adults - used tranquilizers and sleeping pills.\"There appeared to be an interface between one\\'s physical medical condition and his state of mind. People suffering from diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders were found to have psychological problems in common,\" Desai added.Depression was found to be the most common mental illness in the survey. \"There is rift in social life of the urban populace. People communicate barely in families. Personal dissatisfaction, disinterest in work, lack of motivation, domestic problems and marital discord were major reasons behind the mental problems,\" said another researcher.It is assumed that in the next 10 years, these problems will escalate further. Lack of experts such as psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, social workers and clinical psychologists was another big hindrance. There is a lack of beds in mental institutions, too. \"There is shortage of about 8,000 psychiatrists, 17,000 clinical psychologistys and 9,000 nurses,\" said Desai.Delhi health minister Kiran Walia said the government is taking measures to fill in the gap in screening and treatment of mental disorders. \"We are going to introduce mental health programme under the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM). Under this initiative, doctors will make door-to-door visits and provide counselling and necessary treatment. The ASHA workers will be trained on how to screen psychiatric disorders and provide basic guidance to the people,\" said Walia.The government plans to have one mobile clinic in each district, which will have basic treatment facilities for mental illness by the end of this year. \"Many times, families are not able to bring the mentally ill patient to hospital due to their adamant behaviour and non-cooperation. The mobile vans will see such patients at home in emergency circumstances and will take the help of local police to bring them to the hospital,\" said the IHBAS director.',\n",

For example, a department can demand a data entry operator (DTP) on the condition that it will surrender the post of a junior clerk.\"Recommendations regarding surrendering of a post can be made by a committee chaired by the IT secretary and other top bureaucrats. The final proposal regarding surrendering of posts to create vacancies for officers from the MITS cadre can be approved by a high-powered committee chaired by the chief secretary.Several departments have sanctioned posts but those have been lying vacant. \"Such redundant posts can be phased out and instead a new recruit who is well-versed in IT can be appointed,\" the official said.The Union government has rolled out the unique identification project (UID) called Aadhar. The official said, \"We know that the UID will be used for delivery of services that range from opening a bank account to supplying foodgrains under the public delivery system.

We can tie up with software companies. In such a scenario, MITS can be solution.\" The official further said a large number of government employees are yet to adapt to IT. Some officials have not opened their emails for months. Lack of orientation in IT has also ensured below-par utilization of computers.Maharashtra has drawn up its plans for e-governance. For example, it will introduce Maharashtra Mandatory Electronic Delivery of Public Services Act. According to this Act, every citizen will have the option of availing services through the electronic (online) medium.The state has also instructed all departments to use 0.5% of their budget towards IT.

Pappu is a permanent employee of the civic body.Continuing to show apathy and trying to wash their hands off the situation, the officers of municipal corporation claimed both Sushil and Pappu did not belong to zone C, the area in which the tragedy occurred.According to information, the incident took place on Basant Road near Bhagwan Chowk around 4pm.

Saturday\\'s delivery takes JJ\\'s tally of childbirths by HIV-positive women to 1,004 in the last 10 years.This is not an ordinary achievement for J J staffers as not many hospitals are willing to 0take up HIV-positive pregnancy cases. \"Most of the HIV-positive pregnant women who come to us are either denied admission by hospitals or are referred to us,\" said Dr Rekha Daver, head of obstetrics and gynaecology department at J J.The incidence of the babies born with HIV-positivity also has been low, claims the hospital. \"We cannot say exactly how many babies were born HIV positive, as many mothers do not return to get their babies tested. But our estimation says that of all the HIV-positive deliveries, 5-10% of babies get the mother-to-child transfusion,\" said Dr Daver, who is also the head of positive parent to child transfusion (PPTCT).The hospital has achieved the feat with the help of a certain medicine and delivery method. \"According to the guidelines, we give nevrapin before the delivery. We prefer doing a normal deliveryone without making any incisionsto avoid mixing of the mother\\'s blood with the baby\\'s. Also, we give the mother the choice to breastfeed, even though there\\'s a slight chance of virus transmission,\" added Dr Daver.Maharashtra District AIDS Control Society (MDACS), however, agrees that the load of conducting deliveries of HIV-positive women has largely fallen on public hospitals. \"Public hospitals get majority of HIV-positive pregnant women as private hospitals do not want to do these deliveries. While the number of HIV-positive women directly coming to the public hospitals is high, those referred from private hospitals is equally high,\" said Dr S S Kudalkar, project director of MDACS.Dr Y S Nandanwar, head of obstetrics and gynecology at Sion Hospital said that they may have assisted in 1,000 positive deliveries too. \"We do not have the exact record, but the incidence of conducting an HIV-positive delivery is 1% in our hospital. Since we conduct more than 10,000 normal deliveries in a year, we must be conducting around 100 HIV-positive deliveries,\" he said.',\n",
       " '58dcefdbdd8fc135f3ea6322': 'Michael PerschkeYou are no stranger to India, having been to the market earlier with Mercedes Benz. What do you think are the factors that have pushed the luxury segment\\'s sudden surge over the last few years?How has Audi performed in India since you started operations here?How do you see the numbers going for Audi in the coming years now that you have gained a foothold in the market?So where do you see the market for luxury cars by 2019-20?The forecast is awesome. Where do you see Audi in this?What do you think is the differentiating factor that Audi offers against its rivals?What about your model line-up?And what about retail expansion?, the new MD of Audi in India, is a confident man. Having spent a few years in India previously with Mercedes Benz, Perschke is not new to the market, and the transformation it has undergone over the last few years. India, he says, has changed since his last assignment (1997-2000) here. \"And so have Indians and the way they purchase,\" he adds. Luxury cars are no longer the domain of the niche in India and have seen their demand move up-rather shoot up-significantly over the last last three years. The swelling list of millionaires and billionaires has added to the boom and so has the general growth in the economy and the exposure of Indians to western markets and tastes.The luxury car market stood at about 15,000 units last year, largely shared by BMW and Mercedes with Audi-the youngest of the luxury brigade-also chipping in with around 3,000 units. The market is expected to move up swiftly and gain significantly in volumes in the next few years. We go on a luxury drive with Perschke in the company\\'s new A8 sedan as he talks about growth plans of Audi in India and also how he expects the market for luxury cars to behave in the coming days. Excerpts.There are a variety of reasons fuelling this growth in India. These range from the globalization of the Indian economy to the rising wealth and aspirations of people who are no longer shy to indulge in luxury purchases. The buyers are getting younger and want to express, make a statement, about where they are in life. The rising number of millionaires and billionaires is also helping brands like ours. Another factor pushing demand is the availability of the products in the market, which was not there earlierThough the volumes have been small, Audi has been going strong in India ever since it started operations in 2007. Numbers have been steadily moving up and we closed last year with volumes of 3,003 units, which was a growth of 81% over 2009. We expect this to grow by 50% this year and cross 4,000 units.Well, we have a lot of confidence in the potential of the Indian market. We believe that the overall Indian car market will be 5-million-plus by 2019-20, behind only China and the US. As the absolute market grows, so will the volumes for luxury carsI expect it to be very strong. Consider this: the average penetration of luxury in Asia is about 3-4% while in India it is about 0.7%. We feel that this penetration should at least rise to 2% by 2019-20, which roughly translates into an overall luxury car market size of 1,00,000 units.Audi will also move up with the growth of the market. We have laid out a 10-year strategy that defines what segments we will be present in, which cities we will expand to, apart from how we will position the brand. Broadly, by 2020, we want to sell more than what we sell in a market like Japan today. We expect Audi India volumes to move beyond 20,000 units by then. Our ultimate target is to be the number one luxury player in this market, just as we are in Europe and ChinaBut while you speak about the rise in demand, competition is alsohotting up in the market. Your traditional rivals like Mercedes and BMW have also been growing significantly and enjoy a better brand recall and aspiration here?Competition will be always be there, but we are confident that Audi\\'s design philosophy and product statement will keep the brand strong. In any case, the ecosystem is big enough for all the three to grow simultaneouslyWell, we are a brand for the young and are vibrant. We are not a brand for the 55-year-old uncles. Today\\'s Indian wants a brand like ours -one which reflects his personality, which is progressive and aggressive and is seen as defined and distinct.Our current line-up is already well-accepted in the market. This includes the A4, A6 and the new A8 sedans, apart from the Q7 and Q5 SUVs that have been the brand icons in their segments. We would be further adding to the portfolio as we go forward and will be getting in the A7 sportback to the market while also getting in the new A6. And we are also considering bringing in a couple of niche products. The Q3, which debuts by the end of the year, is a natural product for India whenever it gets launchedThis is something we have been doing over the last one year. Last year, we opened dealerships at Mumbai, Kolkata, Jaipur and Bangalore. And in 2011, we have already been on the job which includes showrooms at Chennai and Delhi. In fact, the showroom at Mathura Road in Delhi is one of Audi\\'s biggest globally and is spread over 30,000 sq ft with a mammoth 20-car display.',\n",
       " '58dcf044dd8fc135f3ea633f': 'MUMBAI: The state housing board is probing the sale of a 3-acre Mhada plot, worth around Rs 300 crore, to a private developer last February. The land at Magathane in Borivli was meant for public housing, where 900 flats for low- and middle-income groups were to be constructed.Official sources said the land was sold by Babu Farle, who claimed to be the owner, to Madison Constructions. The civic building proposals department, suburban collector Nirmal Deshmukh and state revenue department endorsed the sale, ignoring evidence from the Maharashtra and Housing Area Development Authority (Mhada).Mhada\\'s Mumbai board land branch cell \\'forgot\\' to update records in the property card for five years although it had won the property back from Farle in 2005 after a 36-year legal battle.In 1958, the state housing board bought eight acres from P R Billimoria and S Billimoria. But the Farles claimed to be tenants as they were cultivating the land and obtained tenancy certificates under the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Land Act,1948, from the revenue authorities. Mhada officials contended the tenancy certificate ran contrary to a 1957 government rule, which stipulated that some land in Mumbai, including Magathane, be excluded from the act.In the 1960s, when the state revenue department rejected Mhada\\'s plea to cancel Farle\\'s tenancy rights, Mhada moved the Bombay high court. In 2005, Farle reached a settlement with Mhada: The family retained 40% of the area while the housing board kept the larger portion. The HC accepted the division and dismissed the tenancy certificates obtained by the Farles.Government sources said Mhada\\'s Mumbai board failed to transfer the land in its name and protect it from encroachers. It forgot about it until the legal department pointed out that the Magathane land was still in its possession. Mhada\\'s then vice president Gautam Chatterjee immediately directed the Mumbai board to plan construction of 900 flats for public housing and Shirke Constructions was awarded a Rs 132-crore contract.In April 2010, Farle again went to court, claiming he did not understand the terms of settlement and that the consent terms with Mhada be set aside, but the court denied him interim relief. Assistant government pleader G W Mattos, who represented Mhada, told the court that Farle had submitted the settlement proposal and produced documents signed by Farle in Marathi. Mattos said Farle had sold his 40% share to a developer.On February 17, 2010, Farle had quietly sought the government\\'s nod to sell Mhada\\'s portion, saying it was tribal land. That day, Farle signed a memorandum of understanding to sell the land to Madison Constructions. He had already sold off his 40% stake to Atul Builders.On April 27, 2010, the revenue department directed that Farle be granted permission to sell the tribal land. The file went to Deshmukh to fix the sale price to ensure the tribals are not cheated. On May 19, 2010, the collector fixed the sale price at Rs 6 crore and ordered sub-division of the land despite it being in Mhada\\'s possession. \"The revenue department conveniently overlooked the fact that some revenue records still showed Mhada as the owner,\\'\\' government sources said.When Madison was unable to pay the money, the collector revised his order, and in October 2010, he issued a show-cause notice to it to pay an increased sale price of Rs 32 crore to Farle. A copy of the notice was sent to Mhada, making a note of the consent terms filed in the HC.This was when Mhada learned what the government was up to. \"We lodged a protest with the collector, told him not to proceed with it and submit a report to the government about Farle\\'s fraud. We also told the collector that Mhada would seek a review of the revenue minister\\'s order to transfer land in Farle\\'s name,\\'\\' a senior Mhada official said.But the collector refused to accept Mhada\\'s request. Mhada got another shock when the civic building proposals department on September 29, 2010, gave it an ultimatum to give proof about the land title. Mhada sent a detailed reply with documentary evidence. In November 2010, Chatterjee ordered Mhada\\'s vigilance department to investigate culpability of its junior employees in not updating the records to benefit Farle.R K Padmanabhan, head of Mhada\\'s vigilance department, confirmed the inquiry but refused to comment as investigations were on. Padmanabhan also wrote to the chief officer of the Mumbai board to start prosecution proceedings against Farle.Mhada simultaneously began the process to file a review application before the new revenue minister, Balasaheb Thorat, to revise the government\\'s order of April 27, 2010, obtained by Farle.According to Mhada vigilance officers, they learned during the inquiry that Atul Projects India Ltd (Atul Builders), the developer who had purchased Farle\\'s 40% stake, had moved the economic offences wing (EOW). The developer alleged that Farle had sold the land he purchased to other developers.Deshmukh said he has not taken a final decision on Mhada\\'s claim to the plot.',\n",
       " '58dcf067dd8fc135f3ea6348': 'Manisha Girotra, CEO and country head of UBS, can\\'t remember the last time she had taken a long leave. But in a company seeped in the tradition of work-life balance, she can\\'t get away with that. Or, perhaps, she can.We were initially supposed to meet the poster woman of Indian investment banking at the Swiss bank\\'s office in Bandra-Kurla Complex, the upcoming business destination in Mumbai. But we got a last-minute request for a change in venue to The Four Season\\'s Hotel at Worli. Little did we know that Girotra had been restricted from entering her own office. But, of course, a workaholic finds a way around such minor problems.Strange it may sound, but some multinational banks have rules where employees, including the CEO, have to stay away from the office for a mandatory prescribed period every year. During that period, somebody else would manage the portfolio to drive home the message that the firm is bigger than employees. So Girotra did the next best possible thing-meet us outside. \"Every employee has to mandatorily stay away from the desk for 14 days. I haven\\'t taken a break for the last three years; have been working at a stretch and this (not going to office) is in a way good,\" she says, but quickly adds that this doesn\\'t matter in today\\'s digitized world. \"Lot of work can be done on the BlackBerry.\" Perhaps, it would put it in perspective if we were to mention that the meeting was on the Christmas eve when investment bankers are usually on leave.Typically, the Noel-New Year season is also a lean period for mergers & acquisitions (M&As). But it has been different this year. A slew of deals, including JSW Steel\\'s purchase of a majority stake in Ispat Industries, Reckitt Benckiser\\'s takeover of Paras and Tata Chemicals\\' acquisition of UK\\'s British Salt, were announced during the last month of 2010. Some others, involving the sale of Patni Computers and Australia\\'s Riversdale Mining, saw bankers burn the midnight oil. Girotra\\'s team was assisting a bidder to take over Patni, while UBS\\'s Australian arm is advising Riversdale. \"It has been a busy deal season,\" says Girotra, sipping tea.Draped in a flowing sea green saree with a silver border, 41-year-old Girotra is a couturier\\'s delight and can effortlessly switch from the boardroom to the ballroom. It\\'s, therefore, not surprising that she has two favourites-Louis Vuitton and Ralph Lauren-when it comes to brands.Coming from a family of bankers-her father was a former top honcho with UCO Bank-it was perhaps natural for the young Girotra to join the banking industry. A post-graduate from the Delhi School of Economics, she started her career with ANZ Grindlays in 1992, and a year later moved to BZW, the investment banking arm of Barclays. In 1996, Girotra joined the Swiss bank and has since been with it. \"We (her family) are a non-diversified risky portfolio,\" laughs the UBS India head-her brother, sister-in-law and husband are all bankers.Her husband, Sanjay Agarwal, whom she met at Grindlays, now heads corporate finance at Deutsche Bank. While both compete for deals, Girotra says \"now we are past that stage\". She recalls during the BJP-led government\\'s disinvestment programme, the divestment secretary had quipped that if one deal goes to Deutsche, the other should go to UBS, otherwise, there will be a fight at home. Another incident she remembers happened during the Infosys Technologies ADS listing in 2005. UBS and Deutsche, along with other banks, were involved in the transaction and it was only after the pricing of the issue was done that the IT company\\'s chairman came to know that they were husband and wife.One thing she likes about deal-making is that of being a \"transformation facilitator\" in the corporate world. And it isn\\'t easy. \"For every 20 ideas, only one may click,\" she says. And closing a deal could take months.Indian companies are transforming into MNCs and are snapping up assets across the globe, changing their market position rapidly.Hindalco acquired Canada\\'s Novelis for $6 billion, becoming the world\\'s largest aluminium rolling company. Bharti Airtel became the fifth largest telco in the world after its $10-billion Zain deal. Girotra recalls that in the not-so-distant past, Indian companies were not even considered in the global M&A scene. \"Today, my colleagues from the sell side first call the Indian and Chinese teams to check about potential candidates interested in a transaction,\" she says, adding that \"this gives us a huge kick\". Dealogic\\'s ranking table reveals that India climbed from 16th to 12th position in global M&A transactions in 2010. Predicting the trend for 2011, Girotra says cross-border deals in the energy and the mining sectors would be most visible while inbound deals would largely be around healthcare. For the record, UBS was No. 7 among takeover advisers in India in 2010.Girotra has been with the Swiss bank for 14 years and so we ask her if she has ever thought of leaving the company. To put the question in perspective, it\\'s important to mention that the number of I-bankers jumping jobs has been higher than the deals. \"UBS is a great employer. I am married with a kid and this (set-up) works out good for me,\" says Girotra, who takes time to attend her eight-year-old daughter Tara\\'s parent-teacher association meetings every now and then.Wealth management is one of the pillars of UBS\\'s business model. It is also this business that drew the ire of regulators globally over tax evasion by its customers. In India, the RBI delayed its banking licence over alleged money-laundering racket, holding up its wealth management plans. The apex bank also didn\\'t approve the UBS\\'s bid to acquire Standard Chartered Bank\\'s mutual funds business. Finally in 2008, the UBS got the green signal to open a branch in India, entering the corporate banking space. So how come UBS ends up on the wrong side of regulators? Girotra laughs. \"We have strong checks and balances,\" she says, adding that she was sure it would not happen under her leadership.In fact, 2011 will be the year when UBS pumps iron. It is gearing up to offer wealth management services. It also plans to enter the mutual fund business in India, but Girotra says it would set up its own venture as against looking at acquisitions. Besides, the retail banking operations of the bank would also begin with a lone branch at Bandra-Kurla in the next couple of months. About 60 people have already been hired and more are expected over the course of the year.Going by her appearance, one would think that she is a fitness fanatic but her answer surprises us. \"I go to the gym once a year. I like cycling, an interest I picked up from my Shimla days. Every 5th of January, I make a resolution to do these things but that is the only day I do it,\" she smiles.Quiz the ace banker on where she sees herself at the end of the decade and she breaks into a big smile. She wants to sign out of targets and deadlines in the next seven or eight years. \"I am looking forward to a January 28 where there are no targets.\" Unlike several dealmakers who have launched their own private equity funds from the millions of dollars they raked in as bonuses, Girotra doesn\\'t have any such ambition.\"I don\\'t have so much money,\" says the UBS India head, who is known for her exotic saree collection. But education is something that really excites Girotra. \"Before my grey cells stop working, I would want to do a PhD.\" Besides, teaching is definitely something that she wants to pursue after retirement.',\n",

Cotton prices, which have soared nearly 40% in the country so far in the year putting mills in a tight spot, crossed $2 per pound for the first time at the Inter Continental Exchange (ICE, New York Futures). Cotton has seen the maximum spurt in prices among the most widely traded commodities in 2011.While prices of Shankar-6, the most widely used cotton variety, have spurted 118.1% since January 2010 and is now at Rs 6,0000 per candy (of 356 kgs), prices have zoomed at an even faster pace at the global level. Cotton prices at ICE have soared 165.8% since the beginning of 2010. It has jumped 41.3% so far in the year. \"I have never seen such a spike,\" said a veteran cotton trader who has been dealing with the commodity for four decades.Crude prices, which have topped $100 a barrel, have moved up 7.1% while silver and copper posted mere 1.6% and 0.7% gains respectively so far in 2011. Gold slipped 1%. Only polypropylene, a versatile polymer, whose prices have reportedly jumped 22% in January, comes closer to cotton.Cotton production in China, the world\\'s largest consumer and producer of the crop, has been impacted by floods pushing up prices, say industry officials. World cotton production is estimated to rise 15% during 2010-11 to 25 million tonnes, which is almost equal to projected mill use, according to International Cotton Advisory Committee, the apex global body on cotton. This comes on the back of a poor season in 2009-10 when consumption topped 24.6 million tonnes and production came at just 21.8 million tonnes.\"Consumption has eroded closing stocks. Though India and the US have a higher crop, it is not sufficient to fill the void,\" says A Ramani, cotton analyst and joint secretary, South India Cotton Association (SICA). Though consumption is on the rise in China, the crop there would be lower by 10-12%, he says.\"There is a shortage in the international market and so it (cotton) is finding its own level,\" says Ashok Daga, former president, Coimbatore Cotton Association. While official estimates peg the crop for the current season at 329 lakh bales (1 bale = 170 kg) in India, 12.8% higher than last year, several industry officials believe that it would be only around 309 lakh bales.Despite higher cumulative arrivals in the domestic market so far in the cotton season (October-September), average daily arrivals are lower than that of last year, say industry officials. \"Cotton has become an investment base. Domestic prices are increasing taking cues from international rates,\" says an industry official.\"Even before the crop started arriving in the market the export quota was announced triggering the first wave of price rise,\" says Sanjay K Jain, joint managing director, TT Ltd, a leading cotton exporter. Mills have not been buying cotton in a big way due to high prices, say industry sources. The average mill has cotton stocks that would last only about a month, much lower than the standard three months, observers say.',\n",

People can get so upset with the medical fraternity that a disgruntled crowd of relatives doesn\\'t think twice before cornering a woman doctor on nightshift at Sion hospital. Earlier, social activist Medha Patkar thought it fit to organize an impromptu protest against doctors at V N Desai Hospital.The doctors are no less agitated. The Association of Medical Consultants (AMC) has tied up with a security agency to send a posse of men within minutes of its members dialling for help to manage an unruly mob. \"There were three instances in the past year when our members dialled this number,\\'\\' said AMC\\'s medico-legal chief Dr Lalit Kapoor.Legislation was passed in April 2010 - the Maharashtra Medicare Service Persons and Medicare Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage of Property) Act -- to book anybody who destroys or threatens to destroy medical property or staff. Police at various stations have arrested people responsible for violence against the medical fraternity, but Kapoor said that it would be a while before anyone is convicted. \"The law is still new and we have to educate policemen about it in some cases,\" he said.He recalled a recent incident in Kalyan in which an engineer verbally threatened a doctor and tried to incite other patients in the waiting room to leave the clinic. \"The doctor went to the police, who were at first reluctant to file a complaint under the act. It was only after the AMC faxed a copy of the act that the police arrested the man,\\'\\' said Kapoor. The offender got bail but the case continues in court. \"There was no violence involved here. It was just angry words and threats. I am sure the man wonders why he couldn\\'t keep his cool that day,\" said Kapoor.Kapoor believes that as people realize over time that there is a penalty to pay if they take the law into their own hands in hospitals and clinics, instances of violence against doctors will reduce.Dr Suhas Pingle, of the Indian Medical Association\\'s Maharashtra branch, said that the authorities had to shoulder part of the blame in the patient-doctor standoff. \"Most suburban hospitals run by the government and the civic body are so short-staffed that they resemble primary healthcare centres after 4 pm. There are no doctors or trained personnel to attend to the patients,\\'\\' he said.Another doctor blamed the government\\'s inability to attract talent to the public health system as one of the reasons for the strained doctor-patient relationship. \"People have to wait in long queues with only one overburdened doctor to attend to them. There is bound to be tension,\\'\\' he said.Pingle said that the suburban system is so ill-equipped to handle patients that many people prefer to go to the big hospitals -- such as KEM, Sion or Nair -- even for ordinary ailments. \"This puts a strain on the entire system,\\'\\' he added.Many in the fraternity also feel that the need of the hour is for doctors to have better communication skills. \"Resident doctors are overworked and at times they are unable to speak appropriately to relatives. This leads to friction,\\'\\' said a senior medical teacher. KEM Hospital has already begun conducting classes for its young resident doctors in the art of communication.',\n",

Big industries consume 6,700 MU (million units)  around 19%  and small industries around 1,591 MU  4.6%  of the 34,554 MU consumed by the city per year. \"Industry consumes only around 25% of the total energy. We have no choice. Let the government give us dedicated power supply, and we will stop using DG sets,\" said energy committee chairman, Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FKCCI), M G Prabhakar.According to the chief electrical inspector\\'s office, there are around 18,000 DG sets in the city, with Bangalore East alone having 7,696 sets. However, experts believe the figure is much higher. The consumption of diesel is also up. Here is an example: there are 127 shops on Brigade Road, and 110 shops have DG sets. Each set guzzles around 15 litres of diesel per hour!There is a third factor: traffic. The 16 lakh vehicles that criss-cross the city contribute heavily to Bangalore\\'s wheezing public. Pollution levels are highest during winter as compared to pre-monsoon days, the study said.Except Mumbai and Delhi, all cities studied  including Bangalore  have maximum contribution from vehicles. Mumbai and Delhi exhibit a high percentage of nitrogen oxide (NOX) from industries, due to the presence of power plants within the city limits.The only good news is that Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) values are declining steadily in almost all the six cities, due to cleaner fuel being provided for vehicles, as also use of low sulphur coal use in power plants.In residential areas, re-suspension of road and soil dust emerged as a prominent source of pollution. Whether it is BWSSB digging a road or the Rs 10,000-crore Metro project, pollution is set off by even the smallest construction activity.What is pollution?The key pollutants in the city are carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOX) apart from dust and pollutants like benzene, while 60-70% of the pollution is from vehicles. But DG sets are also responsible since the emissions are concentrated in a small place, like a commercial hub, and can cause severe health impacts. Benzene is also a carcinogen emitted by petrol.A Manoharan | zonal scientific officer, central pollution control boardWhat causes pollution?*According to KSPCB, there are 5,000 DG sets with large communication towers alone. Of the total 45,000 DG sets in the state, 60% are in Bangalore. However, according to the chief electrical inspector, Bangalore, there are around 18,000 DG sets in all. However, many small DG sets run in commercial hubs* There are around 110 DG sets on Brigade Road  each consumes 15 litres of diesel per hour.*16 lakh vehicles in Bangalore at present*Around 2,000 government projects currently in various phases of constructionAvoid use of DG sets. If you are in smaller set-ups, you could use renewable energy alternatives like solar lanterns or lights* Use fuel-efficient cars* Use handkerchief or mask while passing though polluted traffic junctions* Avoid passive smoking. Try to find which products contain benzene and avoid them* Try to breathe in areas with good green foliage for some time every day',\n",

He announced that the state government would give a grant of Rs 5 crore to the MCS to upgrade the linear accelerator machine for treating patients, particularly those suffering from brain tumour.\"The linear accelerator plant would prove to be a boon for cancer patients. The government is serious about providing proper healthcare to the people of the state.

This facility is available to cancer patients undergoing treatment at the MCS,\" Nitish said.The chief minister expressed satisfaction that the MCS has gradually become a centre for cancer patients, particularly the poor, who visit this hospital from other states. He said that the government gives top priority to healthcare. \"Only healthy youths can ensure fast development of the state,\" he said.People\\'s longevity has also increased due to better healthcare facilities available in district hospitals of the state, Nitish said. He, however, cautioned young doctors not to forget medical ethics while treating patients.Bihar State Board of Religious Trusts chairman Acharya Kishore Kunal said that the MCS had flourished with the help of charity and offerings at the Mahavir temple. The trust has raised the annual budget of the MCS for purchasing medicines from Rs 20 lakh to Rs 50 lakh, he said.Principal secretary (health) Amarjit Sinha said that the child death rate had come down in Bihar due to better medicare facilities available at each block and district-level hospital.

A top official who did not wish to be named said that his company getting offers from potential suitors was nothing new. But the latest bout of speculation sets in at a time when Gati has engaged one of the top four global consulting firms for a major restructuring of its operations. At least two sources familiar with the development said discussions between Hyderabad-based Gati and TNT are under way, but cautioned that deal making has not reached a definitive stage.One source said that Gati promoters could rope in a strategic partner, who could possibly take a majority stake, in their core express delivery business post-restructuring. This division accounts for over 55% share of Gati's consolidated turnover of nearly Rs 1,000 crore. Gati's other operations such as shipping (GatiShips) and petrol pumps are being hived off as part of the ongoing corporate overhaul. The company's demerger of the shipping business would help it to stay focused on its mainstay express distribution and logistics operations, with a special focus on cold chain.A second source said TNT has had protracted talks with Gati over the last few years for a deal in the express delivery business. The names of another global peer United Parcel Services (UPS) and emerging domestic rivals like Coffee Day Holdings, a diversified plantation to cafe enterprise, which entered the logistics play recently, have been linked to Gati in recent past.TNT's local unit, which is focused on the express delivery, has been on the look out for acquisitions even as its international peers DHL and FedEx effected buyouts in the Indian market. A TNT India spokesperson declined to comment on market speculation.Gati had slipped into the red in FY09 when it was troubled by operational inefficiencies of its aircraft fleet, which it got rid of eventually, as well as losses in its shipping business. The company returned into the black the following year and embarked on a restructuring move. Gati wound up its courier business in November last year, which, company sources pointed out, contributed less than 1% of turnover but was a considerable drain on resources.The Indian logistics space has been on a consolidation drive of late with FedEx's acquisition of Mumbai-based integrated logistics services provider AFL Logistics, logistics firm Transport Corporation of India (TCI) picking up 51% equity stake in Infinite Logistics Solutions and Tanglin Retail Realty Developments, a group company of Coffee Day Resorts acquiring a majority control in Sical Logistics from the AC Muthiah family.

Now, additional commissioner of police (north region) Shantaram Waghmare has issued a notification, making parking of four-wheelers on alternate day on either side of the road.However, due to poor enforcement by traffic police, the notification has failed to ease congestion. Sources said, a district court judge had approached the Nagpur Municipal Corporation's traffic department and city traffic police last year to ensure that there is no chaos on this busy road which connects the city with national highway. However, motorists, especially four-wheeler owners, lack traffic sense and park vehicles haphazardly on the stretch between Meshram Putla Chowk and Coffee House Square in Sadar that causes traffic jams.Taking a serious note of this, additional commissioner (north region) Shantaram Waghmare has imposed parking restrictions to ease congestion on Residency Road. As per the notification, single-line parking for four-wheelers on both sides of the stretch between Meshram Putla Chowk and Mangalwari Bazaar would be allowed.From Chhaoni Y-point to Anjuman Complex road, four-wheeler drivers were allowed to park vehicles only in the east direction. However, parking has been prohibited on the other side of Raj Bhavan road (from Anjuman Complex to Chhaoni Y-point).Waghmare said that vehicles, including four and two-wheelers, can be parked on the stretch from Meshram Putla Chowk to Coffee House Square on alternate days. He also clarified that motorists indulging in double or wrong parking would face a stern action.Though the notification was issued on January 8, which will be in force till February 7, it has failed to ease congestion, alleged motorists.Nandkishore Bhoyar, a resident of Chhaoni who uses this road regularly, pointed out that after the construction of the divider, drivers of buses and other heavy vehicles found it difficult to head towards Residency Road. Even a slight error in judging the available road space leaves them stranded and they have to turn back and then go ahead. This is difficult on a congested road and, after construction of the divider, traffic jams on the road had increased, said Vijay Rane, another motorist and a resident of Mangalwari.Yogesh Sapkal said that he had thought that the intervention of the additional CP would make a lot of difference in streamlining the traffic. But it too failed to ease congestion as there is no traffic cop to prevent parking of four-wheelers haphazardly or wrongly, said Laxman Itankar.Motorists blamed that neither the construction of road divider on Residency Road nor the lifting or towing away of haphazardly or wrongly parked two and four-wheelers eased congestion. They said that deployment of just one cop could solve the problem.\",\n",

So if everything goes according to plans, motorists will have to fork out Rs 2,500 as against Rs 200 if caught flouting the speed limits.\"We have sought the Centre\\'s permission to hike the fine amount. We hope to get the permission from the Union home ministry within a month and will start cracking down on offenders after that,\" said B G Shekhar, superintendent, highway police.Shekhar said almost 90 to 99 per cent accidents on the expressway are occurring due to high-speeding and most of them are fatal. \"We registered 19000 cases of high speeding in the year 2010,\" he said pointing out that quantum of vehicles speeding beyond permissible limit is going up everyday.The Mumbai-Pune expressway has the speed-limit of 80 km per hour as has been fixed by the highway police even though the expressway has been designed for the speed-limit up to 100 km per hour.Shekhar said among thousands of new vehicles being added on expressway every year most of them have designed speed of 260 km per hour which is made looking into the roads in foreign countries. Earlier, he said the design speed of vehicles would be limited to 180 km per hour at the most.MSRDC MD and Vice-Chairman Bipin Shrimali said around 12 speedguns, one each after every 15 km, will be installed on 98 km stretch besides close-circuit TVs and LCD screens to monitor vehicles and create awareness. Similarly he said the talks were on with the agencies involved in maintenance over increasing number of mobile vans, ambulances and set up trauma centres to take care of victims within shortest possible time.\"Controlling speed by increasing the fine is the only solution as people, even after slapping a fine of Rs 200, again zoom at a speed more than 80 km per hour. If increased the fine people will not dare to do so,\" said sources with the expressway administration. Similarly the fine for lane-cutting, wrong parking or wrong overtaking will be increased proportionately.Engineers and traffic police say their tests to check whether vehicle driving at 150 km per hour reached first than the one that was drove down at 80 km per hour, revealed that speeding vehicle reached just 10 minutes before. \"If speed is controlled, accidents will not occur for sure,\" experts added. Every month expressway witnesses around 75 to 90 accidents with three of them fatal. Everyday average 30 to 50 cases of overspeeding, lane-cutting and wrong parking are detected.Besides increasing the speed guns on the highway and a force to nab over-speeding drivers the patrolling in the night and morning hours will also be strengthened, sources in the expressway administration said pointing out that over 50 per cent accidents have occurred in the night and early morning hours.Meanwhile, the traffic on expressway between Khopoli connector and Kalamboli will remain closed for two hours between 1 pm and 3 pm on Thursday.This is to facilitate urgent replacement of a major electrical cable crossing from over the expressway.During the closure of the expressway the Mumbai-bound vehicles can take the Khopoli exit or Khalapur connector attached to old Mumbai-Pune highway and then can come back on expressway via Shedung connector.Similarly Pune-bound vehicles can take the old highway between Shedung connector and Khalapur connector which is a 25 km distance and from Khalapur again can get on the expressway to head towards Pune, inform the MSRDC officials.',\n",

He will deliver a talk on `Finding happiness in troubled times\\' at the National College grounds. On the eve of his visit, he writes exclusively for TOI.The inability of human beings to control their agitated minds is the root cause of man-made problems. Thanks to the tremendous stride in technological advancement and human intelligence in recent times, the quality of research on both the inner and physical world has reached higher levels. However, the world is also facing a lot of new problems, most of which are man-made.More than a thousand years have passed since the great religions of the world flourished, including Buddhism. During those years, the world had witnessed a lot of conflicts. I acknowledge the fact that different religions of the world have provided many solutions about how to control an agitated mind. However, I still feel we have not been able to realise our full potential.According to Buddhist philosophy, happiness is the result of an enlightened mind, whereas suffering is caused by a distorted mind. A distorted mind, in contrast to an enlightened mind, is one that is not in tune with reality.Any issue, including political, economic and religious activities human beings pursue in this world, should be fully understood before we pass our judgement. I want to emphasise the importance for practitioners to sincerely believe in their respective religions. It is very important to distinguish between \"belief in one religion\" and \"belief in many religions\".The former directly contradicts the latter. In the past it was not a major problem because nations remained aloof from each other with their own distinct religion. However, in today\\'s close and inter-connected world there are so many differences. For example, there have been a lot of religions in India. Despite this, the fact is that these religions have been able to coexist with each other, and the principle of Ahimsa has really flourished in this country. Even today, this principle has a strong bearing on every religion. This is very precious and India should really take pride in it.In such a society it is very important to have harmony and respect amongst the different religions so we must distinguish between belief and respect. Belief refers to total faith, which you must have in your own religion. At the same time you should have respect for all other religions.If a harmonious relationship is established amongst societies and religious beliefs in today\\'s multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-cultural world, then it will surely set a very good example for others.',\n",

As India is moving away from a socialistic society towards a capitalist system, greed and envy cannot be summarily dismissed as human frailties, said writer and entrepreneur Gurucharan Das at a panel discussion that dwelt on 21st century morality at the Jaipur Literature Festival here on Saturday.He said that envy pushes a person to achieve the success or affluence that his neighbour or colleague has acquired and it unleashes an urge for competition, which is a key ingredient of capitalist culture.However, he said the virtues of this negative emotion, while important, have strong limitations. And this is where Dharma' needs to play a bigger role, particularly at a time, when huge scams and corruption cases are threatening to the tarnish the image of the country, he added.Dharma may mean many different things to many people. Manjushree Thapa, the author of Seasons of Flight' and another panelist, said that meaning of Dharma is very ambiguous and difficult to find moral codes, which in Buddhism are clearly defined. Referring to the Mahabharat, Das said that when Yudhisthira was defeated in a rigged game of dice and left the kingdom to live in the jungles, Draupadi, his wife, asked him to fight and regain the kingdom because it was unfair. It was her understanding of Dharma. But Yudhisthira declined and replied he has given the word (of respecting the rules of thegame) and would not fight. Vidura, the advisor, had a different take on Dharma, who said what was good for people should be followed.Although the great Indian epic doesn't prescribe codes of Dharma, Das said, it gives a number of examples as to how best we could cope with the problems of the contemporary world and in that Dharma seeks civic virtues, not moral perfection in life.Moral reasoning leads to good moral actions. While it is easier to imbibe and practise the virtues of morality in ones private life and circle, extending it to the world he or she faces is a challenge.

She said that studies on certain Indian families where stammering runs in the family was underway, for which she took blood samples of members of The Indian Stammering Association (TISA).TISA was started in 2008 in Mumbai as a platform for stammerers to meet more people like them and share their experiences. The Chennai chapter, which was started in January 2009, celebrated its second anniversary on Saturday. All-India coordinator for TISA Dr Sachin Srivastav said, \"This is a forum where we stammerers gather and speak about various things and we stammer freely and learn to lose our inhibitions.\" He said most stammerers feared job interviews and complained of being unable to perform well in job interviews despite having what it takes to get a job.\"All stammerers have perfect clarity in their minds about they want to say. It is when it comes to speech that they get stuck and have a problem. This can be addressed by meeting like-minded people and sharing experiences,\" Dr Srivastav said.TISA, which has 500 members across the country, has helped many stammerers overcome their fears. \"Till about two years back I would never have the courage to go and talk to people or address a gathering.

This led to visibility coming down initially. The temperature then stabilized but fell sharply again to 8.7 degrees Celsius by morning and visibility went down again. General visibility was below 50m while runway visual range was around 50m-75m for almost three hours,\" said R K Jenamani, director in-charge, IGI Met.Low visibility procedure (LVP) was in place for the new runway for almost nine hours, from 3.32am to 12.30pm. On the main runway, LVP was implemented from 5.45am to 12.30pm. At 4.30am, the RVR was 700m on the new runway. This range, used by pilots as an indication of visibility, came down to 75m within an hour. On the main runway, the RVR fell from 1,800m at 5.30am to 100m an hour later. \"Three flights were diverted as they were set to land in the early hours just when the visibility fell sharply. Airlines had been intimated about the dense fog conditions almost 10 hours in advance so schedule management was much better this time,\" said an airport official.Since no operations were possible for almost three hours, 13 flights had to be cancelled. Air traffic control informed other airports to not allow flights to depart for Delhi until visibility improved. While that meant a number of diversions were reduced, flights got delayed by several hours. \"Our incoming flights were severely affected and the schedule for the rest of the day went for a toss. Since it was not possible to operate on this delayed schedule, we had to cancel some of our flights,\" said an airline official.Met officials said the dense fog was due to a change in wind pattern. \"The temperature was not very low and wind was blowing at a speed of 16kmph. That became almost still in the morning but before that, wind direction changed and the cold northerly started blowing. This led to the drop in visibility to zero,\" said Jenamani.According to Met officials, cityside fog was prevalent only in west and north Delhi. East Delhi areas were relatively fog free. The maximum and minimum temperatures in Delhi on Monday were 22.1 degrees Celsius and 8.2 degrees Celsius, respectively. Shallow fog has been predicted for Tuesday morning. The minimum temperature might drop by 1-2 degrees over northwest India and then rise again by Wednesday.',\n",

IMA\\'s local chapter had organised a similar protest on July 15 last year too, but this time it will be joined by Maharashtra State Medical Teachers Association (MSMTA) and Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD).The three agencies will plan their future strategy during the dharna and rally that will be organised on Saturday to mark the protest. The agencies are claiming that the recent decisions of MCI and government in reducing the teaching staff for graduate and post-graduate courses will prove detrimental to the standards of modern medicine and medical education for future generations.Dr Prashant Nikhade, IMA city president, said that substandard BRHC is definitely going to be detrimental to rural populace. IMA feels that the rural people are not second class citizens and the government for whom only doctors produced from rural sector should treat. The government is not serious in even utilising the services of newly passed out doctors under the existing provisions of compulsory bond.The dissolution of MCI and appointment of board of governors is a slap on the democratic running of the statutory institution of this country. MCI is a well established autonomous statutory council and should be run in that form. \"MCI must be an autonomous body, free of government pressures and democratically elected. IMA will strive hard to restore the autonomy of MCI to protect the norms of medical education,\" said Dr Nikhade. No government arm can regulate and monitor the standards of medical education in required manner. Doctors from all fields should oppose the nominated nature of the body.IMA is also labeling the clinical establishment bill in Parliament without taking IMA into confidence as mockery of democracy. This law will bring licence raj. This act would act as a disincentive for the establishment and growth of private hospitals and nursing homes in cities which form the backbone of medical care in India in the absence of adequate government facilities.IMA is agitating against the alleged illegal suspension of licence of national president and secretary general of IMA by the adhoc body of MCI. Irrespective of the fact that the MCI has no jurisdiction to penalise the office-bearers of IMA, even the quantum of punishment sought to be afflicted is arbitrary. As a matter of fact, as per the information supplied by the MCI on March 30, 2009 to an applicant under the RTI Act. \"There are no such defined guidelines/criteria for determining the quantum of punishment to doctors found guilty after an inquiry in the council\\'s regulation under IMC Act, 1956.The demands* Withdrawal of the proposed clinical establishment act* Withdrawal of BHRC course proposed by MCI* Adhoc MCI body has now powers to make any policy decisions and hence cannot reduce the teaching staff in medical colleges* Adhoc MCI can also not suspend the national IMA president and sectary.

However, abandoned as they are by their original owners, they are now crying for attention and upkeep, thus posing a grave risk to the life and limb of the occupants as well as the general public.Moreover, with the monsoons not far away, if no action is taken by the authorities to save the structures from further damage, disaster may just be waiting in the wings, sources say.The dilapidated and hazardous condition of the buildings, came into focus last year, when a portion of the building, known as the Costa building, located near the Curchorem railway station, collapsed after a spell of heavy rains, leaving the other part in a perilous condition. Two years ago, the old building adjacent to it was gutted in a fire causing tremendous loss to the merchants carrying out their business within the premises.Following the mishap last year Quepem mamlatdar Sudin Natu had, on August 2, 2010, served notices on all the occupants of the said building to vacate their premises within two days in order to avoid any loss to life and property. However, six months later, the location is still buzzing with activities with none of the traders willing to relocate.Chief officer of the Curchorem Cacora Municipal Council (CCMC) Prashant Shirodkar, when contacted, expressed his helplessness in the matter. \"Notices have been served to the traders to vacate the premises but they are not willing to do so. We will have to consider other measures now,\" Shirodkar said.President of Curchorem Merchants Association (CMA) Hanumant Vasta is sore over the \"lackadaisical\" attitude of the authorities in addressing the issue that is directly connected with the safety and welfare of the citizens. Repeated letters written by the CMA to the authorities have evoked no response.Speaking to TOI, Vasta said that the approach of the authorities towards the issue was lopsided. \"They have served notices to the traders for eviction without offering any plans for rehabilitation. How can they throw the traders on the streets just like that? We can identify at least 10 such buildings that are in a rundown condition needing urgent repairs and renovation. The two mishaps involving two old buildings have, sadly, failed to spur the authorities to take any meaningful action,\" Vasta said.The CMA president stressed that proper rehabilitation of traders displaced after razing the old rundown structures would help in solving many civic issues of the town as well including sanitation and parking. \"There are no proper public toilets in the town and a parking system is non-existent. If all the traders carrying out their businesses from dilapidated structures are properly rehabilitated into new buildings built for the purpose these issues will be taken care of, at least to a large extent,\" Vasta said.Meanwhile, it is learnt that directions issued to all the panchayats and municipal councils in South Goa district by the disaster management cell of the South Goa collectorate to provide details about dilapidated houses within their respective jurisdictions have largely gone unheeded.In a letter dated June 30, 2010, chief executive officer of the disaster management cell Y B Tavde had pointed out that \"due to the depleting state these houses have become a threat to the neighbouring houses especially during the monsoons. As such, you are required that a detailed data may be collected with regards to these houses and vide a policy decision, remedial action may be taken so as to avoid not only the actual falling of the houses, but also the fear in the minds of the locals residing in the vicinity,\" the letter said.Inquiries by TOI revealed that that except Mormugao Municipal Council, no other civic body or village panchayat has complied with the directives, thus bringing into sharp focus the apathetic attitude of the self-government bodies.',\n",

An analysis by the university shows that there is more research taking place outside its campus that inside. No one can point to an exact period when research began gathering pace in affiliated colleges, but it has overtaken the university and research institutes in terms of sheer numbers, PhD guides on their rolls as well as PhD students.There are 65 affiliated colleges conducting research and they have 193 guides. The university\\'s 40 departments which enroll PhDs have 160 guides. There are 35 pure research institutes like Haffkine, the Indian Institute of Geomagnetism and National Institute of Research in Reproductive Health, which have 135 guides.Experts say that with an increasing number of colleges pushing the research agenda, the varsity has been forced to start recognizing colleges as research centres that can enroll and guide PhD students. \"Allowing the affiliated colleges to conduct research has improved access tremendously,\" said Vilas Shinde, controller of exams, who conducted the analysis on PhD data of the university.Some of Mumbai\\'s institutions-including IoS, Ruia, Sydenham and St Xaviers-set up basic research labs decades ago, but have regularly upgraded them each time funds poured in. Today, these labs boast of high-end equipment, with all the institutes producing maximum PhDs in science. Matunga\\'s Ruia College has 200 PhDs among its alumni, and it plans to increase the subjects it wants to offer researchers.The university\\'s research funds never supported these colleges. Earlier, they were pinching pennies to even repaint the labs after a few years.

Some labs and schools-Caius Laboratory for interdisciplinary research, the Heras Institute of Indian History and Culture, the Blatter Herbarium for research in botany-are rich with research material.Though set up decades ago, St Xaviers has upgraded them constantly over the past five years. But how did some of these traditional undergraduate colleges face up to the challenge?

But there are many doubts that prop up, about the world around you and your own anatomy also. A time comes when concern and apprehensions become overbearing, especially for girls, who come to grip with menstruation as soon as they attain puberty.The question of being normal and the right age to start the periods, keeps both the girls and the parents a bit tense and worried. There are emotional swings accompanying physical changes as hormonal changes start occurring. Whether a girl experiences her first period early or late, or at right age, there is always a nagging worry that something might go wrong. 'Menstruation is a major stage of puberty in girls. It is a normal process of physical growth. Sometimes some six months before getting first period, a girl might notice an increased amount of clear vaginal discharge. This discharge is common and not a cause to worry,' said Manoj Dutta, Panchkula-based gynaecologist.What fills the mind of girls at this stage is (usually between the age of 8 and 13) what if the discharge is during school time' Mothers should make a record of their daughters' cycle and keep a sanitary napkin in school bag according to a tentative date. But if the girl is worried that a stain might embarrass. 'Parents must reassure that it does not happen so often,' said Mohali-based physician Geeta Sharma.Also after the first period there is an irregularity. Even once you have your first period, your menstrual cycle will be unpredictable for a while. It might take up to two years for a period to get regular because the hormone surges are uneven. It's very common for a teenager to have her period and go one, two, or three months before she has another, because these hormone surges are not high enough. A period is bleeding that occurs each month. During this time, the lining of the uterus that builds each month in anticipation of implanting a fertilized egg is shed. The hormones inside stimulate new physical development, such as growth and breast development. About 2 to 2= years after a girl's breasts begin to develop, she usually gets her first menstrual period.Every woman's menstrual cycle is a little different. However, the average span is three to five days. The ususal symptoms before the period are mood irritability, breast tenderness, or painful cramps in lower abdomen and lower back shortly prior to the onset of first menstrual cycle. In addition to these there can be retaining water inside the abdomen, weight fluctuation, mood swings, and headaches.\",\n",

Thus the height of a speed breaker cannot exceed four inches. White stripes need to be painted one metre before and one metre after the breakers. Speed breakers can be built only in front of schools or other educational institutions, hospitals or temples, where people access those buildings from the road. Accident-prone sites are also considered for speed breakers but that requires prior approval of traffic police.The petitioner mentioned that speed breakers on the road towards Gajanan Nagar violated these norms. Many speed breakers constructed on the ring road that experienced heavy traffic flow throughout the day were also not as per IRC norms. Although, the permission was taken from the traffic police, the above mentioned speed breakers, did not comply with design specifications, he said.Joshi informed that there was no advance warning to drivers as speed breakers were not painted with any sort of luminous paints, nor any reflectors were fixed on them. Their height is 10 inches, which causes them to hit underbody of vehicles. The petitioner has registered a complaint against the NMC officials at Ajni police station stating that the speed breakers were causing a lot of discomfort to the drivers. He also pointed out that Nagpur was riddled with such illegal speed breakers and that NMC should account for them.Earlier, NMC had informed the court it had complied with court orders and was demolishing old speed breakers. However, those located outside the city limits were not within its jurisdiction. During last hearing, the court issued notices to NMC, commissioner of police, and NMC executive engineer Vivek Salve.\",\n",

Many of them are discussing refinance options in a market facing liquidity and inflationary pressures.And these companies may be left with no option but to buyback or repay the bond holders as their stocks are trading lower than the price at which these bonds would convert into equity shares.It is estimated that Indian firms raised over $20 billion in FCCBs in the four years preceding the market crash of 2008. The FCCB binge had peaked around 2006-07, with these bonds raised then coming up for conversion five years later. Interestingly, most of these were zero coupon bonds with significant yield-to-maturity or conversion premium rendering the redemption value steep.Jubilant Life Sciences Ltd ($202 million), Radico Khaitan Ltd ($45 million), Hindustan Construction Company Ltd ($130 million), Punj Lloyd ($62 million), Bajaj Hindustan Ltd ($132 million), Tata Motors (300 million), Reliance Communications ($297 million) and Aurobindo Pharma ($149 million) are among the companies that have FCCBs reaching maturity in the next six months.Among these only Tata Motors and Aurobindo Pharma have their share prices above the conversion price, at least for now.In case the conversion price, that was agreed about five years ago, is far above the current market price, an FCCB holder has four options. To repay the FCCB holders through internal accruals, to borrow from the market and pay back the outstanding, raise equity and pay back the bond holders, or request for extension to FCCB holders.A buyback looks the most likely outcome as the companies do not expect their share price to perk up following a flat-to-negative outlook for Indian markets this year. While repayments are due for some bigger firms like Tata Motors and Reliance Communications, the focus stays on the mid-caps and how they would refinance the bond debt.\"In most cases, companies go for borrowing from the market and pay back the FCCB holders,\\'\\' said a top official at a domestic broking house. \"But since such borrowings are done by companies which have underperformed, for whatever reasons, the lenders try to extract their pound of flesh by charging high rates,\\'\\' the official added.Jubilant\\'s buyback include $142 million in principal and yield-to-maturity payout of additional $60 million. \"We are in a comfortable position to repay this amount on the due date in May this year, as we have tied up funds required to repay this amount on maturity, if not converted,\" said R Sankaraiah, Executive Director, Finance, Jubilant Life Sciences.Radico\\'s repayment involves outstanding bonds worth around $35 million with about $10 million in yields, while that of Hindustan Construction Co (HCC) include principal of $96 million and roughly $34 million in yields. These two firms had effected opportunistic buyback of the bonds at discounts in the past, but still has a significant amount to settle with the bond holders at the time of maturity.Radico\\'s Managing Director Abhishek Khaitan said the company was prepared to repay the FCCBs with short-term loans, while HCC spokesperson said his company has been making provisions and also has undrawn credit-lines to meet repayment obligations. \"We believe the cash balance of the company along with existing credit lines should be sufficient to fund this. However, if the penalty imposed by MoEF (with regard to Lavasa project) is substantial and depending on how much HCC has to contribute - its balance sheet and cash position might stretch,\" a recent Goldman Sachs report noted.Similarly, Punj Lloyd\\'s FCCB outstanding is pegged at $49 million, with a yield or conversion premium of 25.8% taking the pay-out to around $62 million. Bajaj Hindustan\\'s has bonds worth $99.6 million with conversion premium of 32%.Reliance Communications Ltd has FCCBs worth about $297 million due in August, and a total of $1.22 billion by early next year. Tata Motors has $300 million due and another Yen bond repayment worth 11.5 billion. But this is less than 10% of the company\\'s overall debt currently.The head of securities at a global investment bank said he expected the bond holders to restructure if the market turned worse and the mid-caps found refinancing tough. \"They (bond holders) are seasoned risk investors by nature and they would not precipitate a major default scare,\" he argued. But the recent events involving Wockhardt Ltd, which defaulted on FCCB repayments in 2009 and the bond holders led by hedge fund QVT has not been pretty with both of them entangled in a legal process now.The bond-holders, who offered to sell at deep discount in the distress period of 2009-09, are not doing the same any longer. \"There has been a churn among the FCCB industry with some large hedge funds buying out struggling bond-holders in recent past. And one would suspect that they are hoping hoping for some strategic play - like Sun Pharma acquiring Wockhardt bonds - in case of a problem,\" said a bond market observer.At least a few companies facing the FCCB pressure also have a strained balance sheet with high debt and sluggish profit, and additional debt burden at higher interest rates would be threatening to wipe out their net profits.The head of a finance company has an interesting take on companies whose stocks are deep out of the money, meaning the current market price of the stock is far below the conversion price. \"The promoters of Indian companies, which are almost sure they won\\'t have to go back to foreign fund managers, usually default on FCCBs. And Indian laws are such that it becomes futile for the bond holders to take these promoters and companies to task,\\'\\' he said.One such example is Pyramid Saimira. In 2007, the company had raised $90 million through an FCCB issue, but since the company has gone into liquidation, the FCCB holders have almost no recourse to get their money back.',\n",

       " '58dcf828dd8fc135f3ea6512': 'HYDERABAD: A hushed auditorium, a spontaneous applause to a standing ovation. \\'Tumhari Amrita\\', the story of unrequited love read out through reams of love letters, took Hyderabadis through a journey which was moving, thrilling and entertaining all at the same time. On Tuesday night at the packed to capacity Shilpa Kala Vedika, Day 5 of the ongoing Times Hyderabad Festival, it was Feroz Khan\\'s acclaimed play and the understated yet powerful performances of Shabana Azmi (Amrita) and Farooq Shaikh (Zulfi) that had the audience hooked through its length of over one hour 30 minutes.It was almost 18 years ago, that this Feroz Khan production had made its dazzling debut at the Prithvi Theatre in Mumbai (then Bombay). But despite 300 odd re-runs across the globe since then, the play based on A R Gurney\\'s hugely popular \\'Love Letters\\', still had the same sheen, sharpness and sensitivity on Tuesday. Decades could have faded the pages of the letters, but the emotions still seemed untouched, absolutely virgin.Adding brilliance of the script, penned by renowned playwright Javed Siddiqui, were the two stalwarts of Indian theatre, Azmi and Shaikh who essayed their roles with an earnestness that has almost become synonymous with their names, their performances. The fact that the setting of the play did not change anytime through the 1 hour 30 minutes of the show and that the two characters (the play has only two actors) remained tied to their writing desks all through the performance, failed to bring any monotony to the experience. Instead, the audience, who had filled every corner of the Shilpa Kala Vedika, were completely engrossed in the lives of the two protagonists as many seasons and occasions, such as Eid, Diwali and birthdays kept flying through the pages of their lives. In fact, the reactions of many on the stands kept changing with the changing content of the letters that Amrita and Zulfi had written to each other over a tumultuous 35 years. If the happy moments brought a smile to their faces, they were seen silently wiping their tears when the two parted ways, forever.In the past, reviewers of the play as well as Shaikh himself have termed this act as a \"new experiment, new experience\". And that it clearly is so, becomes evident the moment the curtains go up on Amrita\\'s eighth birthday party in the 1940. That only words can convey such a complex story of friendship that soon blossoms into love and is dotted with moments of intense pain and bouts of happiness, is hard to imagine. The unmatchable expressions of Azmi and Shaikh as they read each other\\'s letters, only adds to the intensity. So much so that it makes the spectators almost visualise the characters a dreamy-eyed Amrita who wavers off into a different world each time she sits to write a few simple words and instead pens something like \"Jhoot badi resham ki lehaf ki tarah hai.Usme chupke rehene main bada maza ata hai\" and a more worldly-wise, practical Zulfi who knows that sentiments and duties cannot co-exist and, therefore, says nothing each time Amrita asks \" Mujhse shaadi karoge, Zulfi?\"As the characters age, even Indian history drifts from independence to partition to emergency and so on. And the same religious differences that tear the country apart, make their love story horribly unsuccessful too. The mind-boggling script of conversations is dotted with humour, scathing comments and witty one-liners as Amrita and Zulfi argue and patch-up with equal fervour, making the entire experience more than memorable for the audience who walk out still trying to soak in what they just saw.Known for exploring new forms and bringing much fame to Hindi theatre, Khan\\'s brilliance as a director comes across at all stages of the play and reminds one of his other great works such as \\'Mahatma vs Gandhi\\' (with Boman Irani in the theatre version that was later made into a film \\'Gandhi, My Father\\' by Khan himself) and \\'Saalgirah\\' (with Kiron and Anupam Kher) that too were astounding pieces of art. So, Khan\\'s vision blended with the fineness of the Azmi and Shaikh make \\'Tumhari Amrita\\' a cult play that has been staged at venues across India, Europe, US and Pakistan over the years.',\n",

Excessive extraction and careless chopping of branches and twigs had led to reduction in the forest stock and prevented the natural regeneration of the trees which takes almost 10 years to grow a foot, she added. Besides uncontrolled cutting, the extensive grazing on land was also causing reduction in the regeneration of the pines, she said.Seeking intervention of the community as well as the state forest department for regeneration of the species, Sarkar said innovative plantation strategies were needed to conserve species and generate awareness at the grassroots level for sustainable practices where community could be involved to protect the species from dwindling.The development activities had caused a serious affect on the species in the areas of Kinnaur and Bharmour beside adverse climatic conditions. Pangi, which had still remained a little untouched by developmental activities, still had a larger portion of chilgoza trees as compared to Kinnaur and Bharmour.The areas where chilgoza was found largely comprised politically unstable areas like Pakistan, Afghanistan and Kashmir. Given this fact, Himachal as a politically stable state could speed up its efforts to save them, she added.',\n",

The idea is to allow certain financial institutions to provide guarantees to bond issues of project developers so that they can access the market to generate funding at a lower cost.Bankers said a guarantee from a reputed financial institution could help a project developer that enjoyed a lower credit rating (say, BB) improve its rating (to say, AA) and lower the cost of funds. \"This will also help in the development of a bond market in the country,\" a senior executive at State Bank of India said.An executive at India Infrastructure Finance Company said a scheme was under consideration though the board was of the opinion that only if it was found feasible, credit enhancement should be provided. The government-owned non-banking finance company is commissioning a study to look at the viability. IIFCL is trying to study the economic cost of using the tool, the timing of its introduction, along with possible structures for providing credit enhancement on infrastructure bonds. The tool is being used in several countries, including Indonesia and Pakistan to help create the required infrastructure.Sources familiar with the development, however, said the RBI, which had scoffed at SBI for providing credit enhancement to Tata Motors, is still to agree to the proposal. But with the government keen on announcing steps to boost infrastructure creation, RBI might be willing to accommodate such guarantees provided it did not result in dilution of norms related to overall exposure to a company, including those in the form of loans or non-funded exposure such as guarantees.The government has been looking at ways to provide more and low-cost funding for construction of roads, ports, power plants, airports and rail networks as infrastructure constraints are cited as a big handicap to rapid growth.',\n",

ONGC is a partner in seven of these blocks, including all three producing properties of Cairn.While Cairn had reluctantly agreed to seek the government's consent for a change in ownership in all 10 properties, it has refused to recognise ONGC's preemption rights, a fact that the board noted. In contrast, the ONGC board felt that in line with the SGI opinion, Cairn needs its prior approval for the stake sale, they said.Sources said the ONGC board noted that the Rs 405 a share price Vedanta is paying was about 40 per cent more than its own internal valuation of Cairn India and so it would not like to match the offer or make a counter-bid.The oil ministry and its regulatory arm, the DGH, are also in favour of adding the royalty paid by ONGC to the Rajasthan project cost.In the case of fields awarded under the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP), like the gigantic KG-D6 gas fields of Reliance Industries , royalty can be added to the capital and operating cost of the block, which as per law are deductible from revenues earned on the sale of oil and gas before calculating profits for all stakeholders.The Production Sharing Contract (PSC) for the Rajasthan block is silent on the treatment of royalty and Cairn is opposed to its addition to the project cost as it would lower its profits.\",\n",

Called the Solar Fire P32, it concentrates the sun\\'s rays on a boiler to produce steam that can run a small engine.This steam energy can be used directly to purify large quantities of water, boil milk, produce edible oils, make charcoal for terra-pretta, bake bricks, and anything requiring heat. It can also drive a steam engine to directly power a water pump, oil and flower mills, cotton spinning, juice presses, or any (stationary) application requiring mechanical power.

All the mirrors reflect sunlight on a boiler. Each flat mirror is slightly curved with a triangle device fitted to the back. This allows further concentration so the machine can pass into the category of high concentration without adding significantly more cost. The structure is made of common steel lengths.

Cops will also monitor traffic on roads which will be used for other categories.Many bus routes will be temporarily diverted and some terminuses/stands temporarily suspended and relocated. \"Roadside parking spaces and private car parking within the closed roads and the roads where there is no divider will also be temporarily blocked,\" said Patil.People going toward the railway station have been asked to plan their journey early to avoid delay due to road closures and traffic diversions.The stretch between Mehadia Square and Panchsheel Square will be closed for both two and four-wheelers.He also said that additional manpower will be deployed at busy junctions like Munje Chowk, Chhattrapati Square, Congress Nagar Chowk etc.Parking arrangement for the public will be made at the start point - near VCA Stadium (Sadar), Kasturchand Park, Institute of Science and Morris College T-point.

While PTC Finance is yet to finalise its coupon, those currently in the market and L&T are offering anywhere between 8% and 8.30% with IDFC at the lower end and IIFCL and L&T at the top. This translates into pre-tax return of 17% for those in the highest tax bracket.Most bonds have a tenure of 10 years, and come with a buyback option at the end of five years. The only exceptions are two series from IIFCL that have a tenure of 15 years, with buyback at the end of seven years. Then, there are some from REC and PTC that come without the buyback option.

These are people who instinctively did the right thing. And in the process, some of them, unfortunately, gave their lives to save guests.\"A documentary-style account of events, the case includes video interviews with hotel staff and footage of the attack.It shows how leadership displayed by people in the bottom rank to the top levels in the organisational hierarchy helped in saving lives.It also focuses on the hotel\\'s history, its approach to recruiting and training employees, the Indian culture\\'s \"guest is God\" philosophy and how the hotel would recover after the attacks.Another key concept of the study is that in India and the developing world, \"there is a much more paternalistic equation between employer and employee that creates a kinship.\"Terming it as one of the \"hardest cases\" he has worked on, Mumbai-native Deshpande said it was hard to see people confront their trauma again.\"We objectify it, keep emotion at a distance, but after 15 minutes of questions with a video camera in a darkened room, there are deeper, more personal reflections of what happened,\" he says in the HBS Working Knowledge.Deshpande said Taj employees felt a sense of loyalty to the hotel as well as a sense of responsibility to the guests.He cites the example of a general manager who insisted on staying put and help direct a response to the attack even after learning that his wife and sons had died in a fire on the hotel\\'s top floor.\"Nothing in the employees\\' training could have prepared them for such an unprecedented situation,\" Deshpande said.Deshpande has taught the case in the School\\'s Owner/President Management Executive Education programme.It can also be taught as an example of managing the post-crisis recovery of a flagship corporate brand, he added.',\n",

But before dying he clung on to one of his attackers, Popat Shinde, making it impossible for him to flee. Shinde sustained 80% burns and is critical. He has been arrested with four others.The gruesome killing led to home minister R R Patil ordering an immediate crackdown on the fuel mafia across the state. CM Prithviraj Chavan ordered an inquiry into the incident. He also announced a Rs 25 lakh payment to the family, payment of his salary till retirement and other compensation. Furious gazetted officers plan a strike on Thursday. Deputy CM Ajit Pawar called it a blot on humanity.Sonawane had gone to Chandvad, where farmers had been agitating, and was proceeding towards Nandgaon when he spotted oil pilferage at Panewadi village in Manmad taluka, said Nashik divisional commissioner Jayant Gaikwad.The place has oil depots of major companies like HPCL, BPCL and IOC. When he saw the theft outside the shop of Popat Shinde, he took video footage on his cellphone and also called local officials for a raid.\"Shinde`s servant heard Sonawane calling the officials and alerted his boss. Soon, Shinde`s accomplices accosted the government official, doused him with the kerosene they were stealing and set him on fire.\"Shinde arrived on the scene and got into a heated argument with Sonawane.

Sonawane at that point caught hold of Shinde, who sustained nearly 60% burns and is critical.\"The divisional commissioner said fuel pilferage is not uncommon in Panewadi. The oil depots in the area supply fuel to nearly 12 districts in northern Maharashtra and Marathwada.Gaikwad said Shinde had lost his wife just 10 days ago. \"We are taken aback at how he could have committed such a gory crime while in grief,\" said Gaikwad.

That added a great deal of excitement to the passionate motor sport buffs from this part of the region. But, when it comes to drag racing it has always been a quiet affair. Spitfire Motorsports wants to prove that drag racing is as popular as any other motor sport event by organising a big time meet at the Kari Motor Speedway in Chettipalayam on January 9. Unlike other forms of racing, a drag race is one where regular cars and motorcycles with no modifications can also take part under the showroom stock' or the street stock' category. This is an ideal form of motor racing for novices to take part, says J. Balamurugan of Spitfire Motorsports.The format is simple and allows almost anyone to participate and satisfy their need for speed, he adds.It is also a serious sport which requires a special set of skills when high-powered cars are involved. And, the weekend races are certainly going to spur the interest of racing enthusiasts as well as the average car owner.About the race, it is a straight 400m run of two cars or bikes alongside. There will be a special starting light system which will first be amber in colour. The driver or rider has to start as soon as the green light comes on.The key to competitive drag racing is time. The timing will be recorded as soon as the vehicle crosses the 400m mark. The system will also button the reaction time (the time the vehicle takes to start moving after the green light comes on). In case of a tie  of two vehicles having the same timing  the driver with a lesser reaction time will be placed ahead.The results are classified according to classes and based on the type of vehicle and its cubic capacity.Drag racing is an extremely popular form of racing and attracts a large number of entrants, says Sajeev M. Rajan of Spitfire Motorsports.There are a good number of riders and drivers from Hyderabad, Bangalore and Kerala who have shown keen interest in taking part in the Coimbatore event, he adds.In order to accommodate all entries on a single day, the limit is restricted to 200. For four wheelers, a participant can take part in as many classes but it should be in different cars unless specifically mentioned in the regulations. So, no matter what kind of car you drive there is a place for you on the track.Vehicle checks will be done on January 8 to ensure safety. Only if a vehicle clears this process it will be allowed to take part. Even at the start line, there will be safety checks to ensure the vehicles are safe. The good news is there will be some practice time as well. For regulations and entry forms, participants can visit www.spitfire.co.in or www.speedwaymotorsports.in. Entry forms may be submitted at Autozone on Brooke Bond Road, Spitfire Performance on Narayanaguru Road and Coimbatore Auto Sports Club at Nehru Stadium on or before January 6.\",\n",

These pilots allege that their counterparts in Air India, AI Express and the expats serving the airline get almost 30-50% more salaries than them.\"All erstwhile IA pilots are incurring heavy financial losses. The top AI management has deceived IA pilots by violating the memorandum of settlement of November 30, 2009 and by not keeping its promises to resolve pay parity issue by various deadlines. Since both the airlines are merged, salary and allowanced of all pilots of erstwhile IA and AI should be paid by one single agreement of AI without any discrimination,\" says the letter sent to Jadhav.While pilots say that at least four deadlines have lapsed without the issue of pay parity being resolved, they have now set their own deadline: January 29 when IC code sign is replaced by AI. \"In the interest of natural justice and to maintain industrial peace and harmony, you are requested to ensure before January 29, salary and allowances of all erstwhile IA pilots (are) paid by one single agreement of AI. Also arrears (should) be paid from the date of merger of both airlines that was announced, failing which ICPA will be constrained to take any action which may be deemed fit,\" the ICPA letter says.AI CMD Arvind Jadhav had said in a statement on December 30, 2010, after the government cleared infusion of Rs 1,200 crore into the airline that working conditions across all sectors of AI would be harmonised along with \"streamlining compensation packages across all sections of employees.\" He said talks with employees would begin within 90 days. Now the employees are waiting for some concrete action and not satisfied with words alone.',\n",

And, for this 5,000 medical teachers are required in the state.Take the present status - The state boasts of six medical colleges with 1,200 medical teachers that includes both regular and contractual appointees.To get the required ratio of population and doctors to 1000:1, Bihar needs 70,000 more doctors against the present strength of about 4,500 doctors. Again, to run effectively various schemes under the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), 15,000 doctors are required as against the serving 4,500 doctors.There is acute shortage of doctors in the state making it one of the big-gest challenges confronting the state government. According to an esti-mate, even if the state gets 20 medical colleges, it would take nearly 20 years to overcome the problem of shortage of doctors in the state. Bihar State Health Services Association (BSHSA) secretary Dr Ajay Kumar said, \"The state government has to initiate several measures to fill the gap. The doctors and medical teachers should be appointed on yearly basis by taking the recruitment process out of the purview of the Bihar Public Service Commission as in Haryana.\"Contractual appointments should be in practice only till regular ap-pointments are made, he added.He said that the eligibility criteria for recruitment in the Bihar Health Services should be the same as in the Central government and some other states which is MBBS plus one year internship, till recently followed in Bihar. Further, health services should be christened under \"special\" category as recommended by the Tikku Committee (1990), Dr Kumar said, adding the service conditions should be brought at par with the Central doctors.He asked the state government to provide additional incentives to doc-tors to work in rural areas, as recommended by the NRHM and provide enhanced pay and other incentives to government doctors as per reports of NCHM, 2005.',\n",

The girl was rescued last Thursday by volunteers of Childline, an NGO, and is now undergoing rehabilitation in the state government\\'s Karuna women\\'s shelter home on Katol Road.The matter is under investigation by the Koradi police who are, however, yet to register an offence.According to activists of Childline, the girl (name withheld) was virtually pawned with the family of businessman Rajesh Janiani, a resident of Mankapur, some five years ago when she was just 12-years-old. Her mother Sita (name changed on request), a resident of Lashkaribagh, desperately needed money for the treatment of her elder daughter Sunita, then 14, who was later diagnosed with brain tumour. Sita works as domestic help in some houses. Her husband, a habitual alcoholic, does no work.Sita approached the Janianis through a neighbour Sheela who used to work as domestic help with them. Janianis apparently extended a loan of Rs 7000 to Sita. They asked her to let her children work with them for some time in order to repay the loan. Sita says she agreed since it was summer vacation and sent her daughter and son to work with Janianis who run a grocery store in Sadar.Initially, the girl was first sent to Agra for six months to look after a handicapped relative of the Janianis. After the person\\'s death, she was brought to the city.Sita says since then she was not allowed to meet her daughter. Janianis allegedly kept the girl at their home while her brother was employed at their shop. Both suffered frequent beatings at the slightest pretext. The girl has revealed to her rescuers that she was given just four rotis with pickles every two days to eat and a cup of tea with one biscuit in the morning.Childline volunteers said neighbours had confirmed hearing the girl being beaten up by the Janianis and crying. The couple\\'s two grown up sons, both in their 20s, too used to beat her up. Whenever the family went out, the girl would be locked up in the store room with a stock of rotis and water to last her for the period of the outing. On Wednesday, the Janianis were all set to go to Goa for a vacation after locking her up thus.After suffering abuse for about two years, her brother ran away to Bilaspur. A missing complaint was lodged about this but he returned on his own about a week later and resumed working with the Janianis. Since then, Sita says he did not suffer beatings and was working in Janiani\\'s shop only during the day. They were not allowed to meet the girl though.According to Sita, whenever she went to see her daughter, she was sent away on some excuse or only shown the girl from a distance. She was all the time assured the girl was fine.Sita says the kids were not paid anything for their work. She continued with the arrangement even after the loan amount was settled because she thought the girl was being taken care of and was even getting some education. When for prolonged period, Sita could not see her daughter she became apprehensive.She says she even went to the Koradi police who did not entertain her complaint. Sita approached the crime branch a few days ago but the cops here too made perfunctory enquiries with Janianis who told them they did not have any girl in the house. Finally she was helped by Aruna Gajbhiye, principal of Tirpude College of Social Work, who suggested that she approach Childline, a central government initiative to help children in distress run with the help of NGOs.Childline volunteers Vasanti Deshpande, Sanyogita Durge, Asha Sonawane, and its city coordinator Barnic Gangmei, with the help of staff from Koradi police, then reached Janianis and rescued the girl who was in a trauma and was not even speaking. She apparently had injury marks on her body. She is undergoing counselling at the shelter home.The Koradi police said her statement would be recorded once she is able to speak coherently and then offence would be registered.The Janianis, however, said they never tortured the girl. \"We were planning to even marry her off and had opened a bank account in her name too,\" said Rajesh Janiani, adding that she was like a daughter to them.While agreeing that Rita did borrow money from him, Rajesh said, \"The amount was Rs 75,000 which she has not returned. Rita in fact wanted to sell her daughter who also did not want to go home to her alcoholic father.\"',\n",

In fact, most popular serials in the US and UK are shot entirely on film, unlike in India, wherein shooting of serials is restricted to video technology.\"While shooting a film, the economics of scale have to be worked out carefully and the technical equipment used greatly depends on the subject of the film,\" said Kanal. He gave examples of films like Dibakar Banerjee\\'s Love, Sex Aur Dhoka\\' that was shot entirely on digital technology, while Danny Boyle\\'s Academy Award-winning film, Slumdog Millionaire\\' was shot partly on film and partly on digital.\"In India, most films are shot entirely on film. But soon a trend will emerge where films will be shot partly on film and partly on digital. This will also make film projects cost-effective,\" said Kanal.The experts said, standardisation for digital film broadcasting is also missing. \"Also, high definition technology is still not officially recognised by the state government, for grants to filmmakers, who want to be cost-effective in their projects,\" added Nirgudkar.But they showed a ray of hope in the near future.

Most schools don\\'t seem inclined to implement the provisions of the RTE Act as the state government has failed to frame rules in this regard.A few schools are not even accepting the forms under this category, while others are asking the parents to submit complete set of documents including income and domicile certificates.There is so much confusion that many parents do not even understand the modalities of the act. NGOs too have failed to raise awareness about the act among the public.As a result, few parents under the EWS category have dared to approach the premier schools for their child\\'s admission. \"I can never think of sending my children to a private English-medium school but I have dared to purchase an admission form of a known private school in the city hoping that they will abide by the law,\" said Rajnish Sharma, a clerk in a private engineering college.While at the face value schools have welcomed the RTE provisions, but have demanded some changes in the clauses. Damodar Goyal, president, Society for Unaided Schools in Rajasthan argued that schools should be allowed to fill the vacant reserve category seats with general candidates so that they do not incur losses.\"Fees is the main source of income for the schools. If the Centre doesn\\'t give any subsidy for taking 25% students from weaker sections, then schools will be left with no choice but to pass the burden on to the other 75% students,\" said Goyal.He also argued against the provision that defines weaker section children as those who belong to a BPL family. \"This doesn\\'t define the BPL family either. The Act should have a clause under which BPL family having a BPL card from a competent authority can avail of the benefit,\" said Goyal.He also objected to Part 5 of Rule 5 which states that local authority shall ensure that names of all children enrolled in the schools under its jurisdiction must be displayed at the school notice board. He said schools will require a lot of space to display the names of all students. \"It will not serve any purpose rather could be used by some miscreant to gather information about a child,\" he added.K B Kain, principal, Delhi Public School, said this clause would create a difference in the minds of children. \"Schooling is not about classrooms.

If the security glitches are substantial in number which possibly led to the crime, the cops will ask the insurance companies not to accept the claim made by the faulty banks or other financial institute.However, it will depend on the insurance company to judge merit of the police\\'s assessment about the security negligence and its agreement clauses with the bank and accordingly act upon the insurance claim.In the Monday theft incident in which a driver of a security firm escaped with Rs 1 crore in Ashok Nagar police station area, the cops will write to the insurance company detailing the negligence on part of security firm.The cops claimed that there had to be two security guards while transporting cash to ATMs from the bank\\'s treasure. There was only one security guard along with three security firm\\'s employees and a driver. While the security guard and the three employees escorted a part of the total cash to the ATM in MGF mall, the driver was left alone in the van.

However, only a small proportion of respondents\\' parking in Ahmedabad was priced, so an expectation of free-parking may have developed.Better management of on-street parking is essential and should not wait until there is \"enough\" off-street parking, say experts. However, many South Asian cities seem poised in the early stages of a conventional parking policy with the potential to gradually spiral toward a costly and destructive auto-centric approach, as seen in parts of Southeast Asia.Pooja Sanghani, programme officer at ITDP and contributor in the study, said that parking is not yet seen as an effective tool to decrease car dependency in Asian cities including Ahmedabad. \"In fact, unregulated parking that is easily available at very low price has only led to increased car use globally. Developed cities in the US and West Europe are now embracing cycling and walking as building more parking infrastructure has not solved their traffic problems,\" she said.',\n",

It will enable book lovers to cut down their check-in and check-out time for books and other reading material. It will also address the problems of long queues and shortage of supporting staff.Speaking to TOI, Prof B Hanumaiah, BBAU vice-chancellor, said, \"The RFID technology will ensure hassle free issue/return of books, as there will be virtually no queues lines at the check-out counter of the library. A student need not to enter the library either to issue or return the book. A small window outside the gate will ensure the flow of books.\"RFID is a technology, which uses radio waves to automatically identify the people or object. Working beyond the established security systems, in RFID, the tracking system combines security with more efficient tracking of materials throughout the library. The RFID technology application includes the RFID tags, reader or interrogator, which will ensure tracking the location of each and every document of the library.The users will be issued the library smart card and immediately they will be asked to become a member of RFID software. \"The RFID system will detect the non-issued books, thereby keeping a track on them. It will replace the manual system of issuing and depositing the books. We will be able to keep an account of the students, status of the book, issued and keep a daily inventory,\" said university librarian, KL Mahawar.With this new system in place, radio waves will be used to track the movement of books, sort them and gather data. In fact, RFID is best for security control. \"A micro chip will be attached to every book and RFID system will record the number of times a particular book is being issued. There will be little chance of a book getting misplaced, and it will be user-friendly too,\" said Hanumaiah.Even the students are excited about the upcoming change. \"Issuing and returning books will be much simpler with RFID in place. It will save a lot of time and ease the work,\" said Sheena Roy, who visits the current library almost everyday.The Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow too has partially implemented the use of RFID technology in its library management system.',\n",

The erupted mouth of the vents have water temperature around 116 degree Celsius and after earthquake the temperature even reaches 126 degree Celsius under which hardly any zooplankton can survive.Delivering a lecture on `The Effects of Hydrothermal Vent on the Marine Life' at Central University of Bihar (CUB), Hwang said that the most recent evidence shows that the low pH can limit the stony coral distribution. Hence no coral reef can be distributed near the vent.Outlining the possibility of using environmental-friendly agents, copepods, as predator to mosquito larvae, he said that several other biological agents such as aquatic insects, mosquito fishes and even plant products could be applied to control mosquito population in near future.He further pointed out that National Taiwan Ocean University and CUB can undertake collaborative studies on the effects of differential flow rates and turbulence strength in Ganga river system on animal behaviour and community structure and copepod as biocontrol agent of mosquito.\",\n",

He was 66 then.In 2009 at the Comrades, Gleve was running past the 30km mark when he was tripped. \"When I opened my eyes, I was in the middle of road. I got to my feet in about five minutes. A paramedic drove up to me and asked me if I was okay. I said I was. But when I tried to breathe, there was a stabbing pain on left side. I was examined by a doctor and I was told I had a hairline fracture on my left rib . I had flown 4000 miles, spent six-month pension and trained for half a year. I am not quitting.\"I was given an ice bag and ran the last 60 kms carrying the icebag,\" says Gleave. Last year Gleave ran his last Comrades after crossing the age limit to run this year.

The country's largest stock exchange has argued that the CCI order is antithetical of principal purpose of the Competition Act, which is to protect and promote consumer welfare.The penalty on NSE is the second highest levied so far. It was only last week that DLF faced a bigger penalty from CCI. For NSE, the Appellate Tribunal is the first level of appeal . An NSE spokesperson confirmed that the exchange had gone to CAT but refused to share further details.In its petition, NSE has sought interim relief against the payment of penalty and against any possible claims by MCX-SX or any other party. MCX-SX executives had earlier told TOI that the exchange, whose activity is restricted to currency futures trading, would explore the possibility of seeking damages. MCX-SX has argued that by not levying a fee on the currency derivatives segment, NSE was using its dominant position in the market to the detriment of other players.In its petition to CAT, NSE has said that following the CCI order, it has been forced to levy charges amid indications that MCX-SX and United Stock Exchange would also follow suit. This it said has resulted in a decline in the trading volume and NSE's share in the segment has declined by 8-9 %.\",\n",

Statistics gathered by the Ponda police show that for the period of January to December 2010, 37 persons died in 36 fatal road accidents. Of these 17 were two-wheeler riders, 11 were pedestrians, four were pillion riders, three drove four-wheelers, one was a bus passenger and another was killed as the parked truck he was sleeping behind, reversed over him when started.Ponda police, whose 315 sq km-jurisdiction covers Banastarim bridge in the north, the Sanjeevani sugar factory in the south, Usgao bridge in the west and Borim bridge in the east, recorded seven deaths in six road accidents in November 2010. July came second with four deaths in two accidents, while January, March, June, August, September and October saw three deaths each.While two people died in road accidents in February and May, April recorded a single death, even as December, saw seven accidents, but, thankfully, no deaths. A total of 384 accidents were recorded in the year gone by.Incidentally, while the total number of accidents recorded in 2010 were 49 more than 2009\\'s 335, the fatalities were a tad lower than the previous year\\'s 42 deaths in 43 fatal accidents.A total of 563 vehicles were involved in 2010\\'s accidents, including 152 two-wheelers, 121 trucks, and three trailer trucks. Police also registered accidents involving 100 cars, 40 mini buses, 30 tempos, 28 jeeps, 13 tankers, seven buses, five pick-ups, four rickshaws and 14 other vehicles, including bull dozers.Transport minister Sudin Dhavalikar attributed the cause of fatal accidents to \"narrow roads\" and to the population-vehicle ratio in Goa. Citing the example of Meghalaya, Dhavalikar said the North Eastern state has a population of 12 lakh, but had only 9,000 vehicles registered. In Goa, the 14 lakh population (as per the 2000 census) has a ratio of one vehicle for every two people, he said.Ponda\\'s assistant transport director Nandkishor Arolkar said most fatalities were caused by negligent and rash drivers. Inter-state vehicles not familiar with Goa\\'s roads, and speeding mining trucks trying to muster more trips, were the main perpetrators, while two-wheeler riders were inevitably the most common victims, he said. \"Improper road engineering-like the puzzling Mangueshi junction which sees accidents often-is another cause of accidents,\" said Arolkar.Explaining the lack of sterner policing, he said, \"We are severely short-staffed. We don\\'t have enough motor vehicle inspectors, and it is difficult to man every road and to control all the traffic, especially speeding motorists.\"Ponda traffic PI Salim Shaikh said, \"Our present roads require vehicles to travel at 40 km/hour, which is never done.

This was double the number affected in November.Civil aviation ministry estimates show the number of passengers distressed by delays more than doubled in just one month, from 70,000 in November to 1,55,016 in December. Analysts say this number would have been much higher had Air India submitted its estimate of delays. AI has not provided data on passengers affected by delays for the past three months.November recorded a 50% rise in delayed flights compared to August and September. Figures for October were not available. Of those affected in December, more than 70,000 passengers were booked on GoAir, around 43,000 on Spicejet, and more than 19,000 on Jet Airways and JetLite.Flight cancellations too were manifold in December, affecting 30,950 flyers in the country. In November, only 7,464 fliers were affected by flight cancellations. Spicejet fliers were hardest hit followed by Jet Airways.Major factors contributing to delays and cancellations were the fog in Delhi and other north Indian cities and the runway repair work in Mumbai. Besides, the number of passengers in December was higher as it was the Christmas and New Year season. Mumbai airport alone saw a record 2.6-million passenger traffic in December 2010. \"Fog in Delhi sent all flight schedules haywire. On December 24, flight operations were suspended for a long time due to very low visibility. Many flights were cancelled. Fog was a major contributor to delays even in Jaipur, Bangalore, Hyderabad,\\'\\' said an official at Mumbai airport. \"Runway maintenance work at Mumbai airport was a secondary reason. Due to unavailability of the main runway, flights were delayed as the secondary runway cannot accommodate as much traffic,\\'\\' he added.The ministry report shows most of these passengers were compensated by the airlines. While those on delayed flights got refreshments, fliers who faced cancellations or were denied boarding due to overbooking were either refunded the full fare or booked on other flights. Many were given accommodation.Industry insiders said the figure could be much higher. \"First, AI hasn\\'t provided its data. Secondly, these are figures recorded by airlines. There are instances where passengers are not provided any compensation. Many are unaware of their right to a refund or ask for a refreshment,\\'\\' said a senior ministry official.',\n",

The minister wants he wants to do it by following the Olympic charter to make the regulation the \"law of the land\".The most important part of the planned legislation is having a term and tenure regulation for office-bearers of national sports federations, an issue which had brought the ministry into conflict with the Indian Olympic Association and other federations last year. This surely is not happy news for those federation officials who have been sticking to their chairs for years.Maken has made it clear that he wants to go ahead by getting \"everyone on the board\". He said the proposed legislation would be put on sports ministry\\'s website on February 20 for a month during which the stakeholders could offer comments and suggestions on it. Two weeks after March 20, the process would start to prepare the draft to be finally presented in the parliament.The new sports minister said the proposed comprehensive legislation would be widely based and would incorporate essences of 1. Basic Universal Principles of Good Governance (BUPOGG) 2. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) charter 3. Good international legislative practices, 4. Anti-doping laws 5. Measures against sexual harassment and 6. Age fraud detection.\"Citing the IOC charter, he said the legislation would be taking inspiration from it while deciding on terms and tenures of sports bosses. He said the charter prescribes a retirement age of 70 for IOC members and also states that a member may serve for a maximum two successive terms in the IOC executive board regardless of the capacity to which he has been elected.\"In case the member has completed two successive terms, he may be elected again after a minimum period of two years,\" he read out from the IOC charter and added that the charter says that \"the president is elected by secret ballot from among members for a term of eight years, renewable once for four years.\"Maken also said that the legislation would lay emphasis on clear, transparent and fair elections.\"Measures against sexual harassment would aim at ensuring that the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court judgment in the Vishakha vs State of Rajasthan are implemented and taken into prospective while contemplating protection of women in sports from sexual harassment,\" he said while adding that fool proof guidelines for detection of age fraud by athletes was needed to be formulated and put forth as binding legislation.Maken was optimistic when asked whether the parliament, which has many members heading different national sports federation, would pass the legislation. \"This has been discussed twice in the parliament. In fact, the Rajya Sabha members said a regulation should be in place.\"Maken said India can go ahead with the legislation quite like the way done by different countries like United States of America and Malaysia. \"If US and Malaysia can come up with legislation on certain issues relating to governance of sports bodies, why not India?\"',\n",
       " '58dd0561dd8fc135f3ea690a': 'BANGALORE: International low-cost carriers flying into India have hit serious air pockets. NOK Air, Tiger Airways and Jetstar Asia have already faded from people\\'s memory. Some of the few remaining players are said to be struggling to generate a decent economic return.From January 11, Malaysian low-cost carrier AirAsia ceased operating out of Hyderabad and Thiruvananthapuram. Last year it scaled down its Bangalore operations from a daily flight to four flights a week. It\\'s also withdrawing its Chennai-Penang route, on which it had a complete monopoly, and instead converting that to a Trichy-Kuala Lumpur route.Bruising fare wars have been one reason for the exits by these carriers. But there are other equally important reasons: low load factors, poor onward connectivity and competitive holiday packages offered by full service airlines.\"International point-to-point traffic is limited for these low cost airlines,\" said Ankur Bhatia, executive director of aviation consultancy firm Bird Group. So, if your flight gets delayed at your India boarding destination, and you miss the onward flight, these carriers don\\'t have the bandwidth to quickly provide an alternative or to put you in a hotel. On the contrary, full-service carriers like Malaysian Airlines, SriLankan, Thai Airways and Singapore Airlines connect passengers to other destinations. They also offer competitive holiday packages. And passengers don\\'t mind paying a few extra bucks for hassle-free travel. \"Indians want value if they are flying low-cost. If they are paying for food, water and blankets, it reminds them of a train journey,\" says aviation analyst Devesh Agarwal.Thai low-cost carrier NOK Air began operations in June 2007, it was positioned as a shoppers\\' airline offering discounts at malls in Bangkok. But the airline withdrew the Bangalore-Bangkok route in November of the same year. This was attributed to poor passenger response. Singapore-based Jetstar Asia also met a similar fate three years back. It suspended the five flights per week service on the Bangalore-Singapore sector.For AirAsia, some of the withdrawals have been on account of poor load factors. \"We were not seeing growth in the Chennai-Penang route. It is not as profitable as we expected it to be,\" said Suresh Nair, the India head of Air Asia.Another problem is that since low-cost carriers operate on slim margins, they don\\'t engage travel agents as much as full-service airlines do. Many potential passengers on these flights are first-time travellers, but such travellers are often not familiar with the documentation work. They rely on a travel agent to process their visas, arrange for hotel bookings, holiday packages etc. But since low-cost carriers have a limited engagement with travel agents, they lose out on first-time travellers. \"These carriers typically depend on online ticketing and have not been travel-agent friendly,\" said B Ashok, director of Excelsior Travels.Cost has been the reason for AirAsia\\'s exit from Hyderabad. GMR\\'s Hyderabad International Airport recently increased the UDF (user development fee) from Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,875. AirAsia offers a Hyderabad-KL ticket at Rs 4,500. \"In this case, we pay Rs 1,875 as UDF, Rs 230 as passenger service fee and Rs 515 as service tax. It\\'s not feasible to run the show,\" Nair said.Capt G R Gopinath shares a similar view. \"Most of these carriers require alternative airports. Airport charges are so high that they are sometimes 50% of the fare. This makes it economically unviable,\" he says.However, some of the low-cost carriers from the Gulf still look optimistic about India. Air Arabia flies to some large Indian cities, and many smaller ones like Nagpur, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Coimbatore, Kochi, Kozhikode and Thiruvananthapuram, helping passengers fly directly from and to their hometown. Dubai\\'s low-cost carrier FlyDubai started a Dubai-Lucknow direct flight in June last year, and is now awaiting clearance to operate from south India.Given that airport charges in smaller cities are lower, these destinations may be more viable for low cost carriers that see sufficient passenger numbers from those places.',\n",

The bacterium has an incubation period of up to five days during which the patient shows symptoms of diarrhoea leading to severe dehydration and can die if not treated on time. Incidentally, there has been a spurt in diarrhoea cases in the city in the past two weeks with nearly 200 patients seeking treatment.However, civic health officials consider the Hanging Drop test as \\'presumptive\\' and insist that the samples have to be subjected to a culture test for confirmation.

This has happened for the first time in the industry\\'s history, threatening the existence of small and medium players in the weaving and processing sector.The reason is a phenomenal 50 per cent increase in the prices of polyester filament yarn -- main raw material for the man-made fabric industry -- since November-2010 due to the increase in crude oil prices and increasing demand in the export markets like China, Pakistan, Europe, North America etc.Industry players said the production of polyester fabric -- grey fabric -- has decreased from 3 crore metre per day to 2.10 crore metre per day in the last two months. The weavers, especially the small and medium ones, are not able to shell out the high asking price for the polyester yarn.From September-2010 to November-2010, the fibre manufacturers, mainly giants such a Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), increased the yarn prices by almost Rs 110 per kilogram from Rs 63 per kilogram. Further, the prices have gone up to Rs 150 per kilogram in the last three months from November-2010 to January-2011, making it difficult for the weavers to operate their units.\"The alarm bells have started ringing for the man-made fabric industry here. If the price rise will continue for a couple of months, then many weaving and processing units would be forced to down their shutters,\" chairman of Federation of Indian Art Silk Weaving Industry (FIASWI) Arun Jariwala said.According to Jariwala, the fibre prices were increased last year when the crude oil was $70 per barrel and the prices have continued to rise when the barrel is at $100. The government needs to look into the issue about the price disparity.The man-made fabric industry in the city has about 6.30 lakh powerloom machines, 400 processing units and 5,000 texturising units consuming about 6 lakh metric tones of different category of yarn fibres including polyester filament, nylon filament, viscose filament, blended spun yarn etc. per annum. The industry employs about 10 lakh workers in the powerloom, processing and texturising sectors and employs another 3 lakh workers in the ancillary industries.If industry players are to be believed, then the cost of finished fabrics have gone up by almost 40 per cent in the last three months due to the increase in the cost of production.

For mining leases for areas more than that, the reports have to be given in a phased manner, with the periods ranging from one year to five years from the notification.There have been allegations about companies holding captive mines for years and not undertaking mining which causes revenue loss to the government because the areas were leased out for a pittance many years ago while companies hope to make a killing when market prices rise. In most of these cases, the government does not even have an idea about the possible resources held by these companies.Officials say initial estimates suggest there could be 200-odd companies who are holding leases for areas where even the preliminary exploration has not been done.Mining secretary S Vijay Kumar said: \"These are areas that were leased out 30-40 years ago and we do not even have an idea about the actual amount of land and how resource-rich it is. As we go in for privatisation it is important for us to know the full extent of the resources we hold. The companies have to do the prospecting at their own cost for areas where the prospecting report has not been submitted to the Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM).\"Companies which hold more than 50 hectares need to submit a yearly progress report with expenditure details and an interim prospecting report. Once the prospecting has been done, they have to submit a feasibility report as well.The state governments have been asked to include this condition for all mining leases issued before 2003 and send a modified lease agreement to IBM.

With about 610 \\'chase-and-challan bikes\\' and 4000-odd traffic policemen, mishaps and fatal accidents also decreased in the city in 2010. Fatal accidents decreased by 9.34%. Other accidents too reduced by 3.01% from last year.A special drive on checking drunken driving that was started on December 25 has already yielded results with drivers fearing the section 185 of Motor Vehicles Act under which violators can be fined Rs 2000 or sentenced to six months in jail or both. Repeat offenders can be fined Rs 3000 and/or jailed up to two years. Since August, 700 persons have been convicted out of 2500 challans issued for drunk driving and still more are expected to be given a jail term ranging from one day to two years. Last year, 10,161 people were fined for driving under the influence of alcohol. Out of this, driving licences of 580 were suspended while 710 people were imprisoned up to 10 days.Significant improvement in lane driving during peak hours has also been seen in the 15 zero tolerance corridors. Top police officials claimed that several new stretches will be identified in the coming months for similar lane-driving enforcement. \"Traffic management through the lane system and fines during the Commonwealth Games was highly praised worldwide. Fines and lane system can be Delhi\\'s key to smooth traffic management,\" said Gupta.The introduction of Intelligent Traffic System which will rely more on technology and less on manpower is soon expected to ease congestion, improve safety and reduce travel time. Mobile police patrolling, action against obstructive and improper parking, real time traffic information, community participation through Facebook and SMS is expected to further improve traffic problems in the capital.This year, the city traffic police will also ensure strict lane discipline.',\n",

Notable among them is a process to increase the number of posts for resident doctors in state medical colleges. A decision to this effect is being taken after a gap of 39 years and is to be implemented in 2011-12 academic session in all possibilities.Officials associated with the decision making process said that in all, 126 senior residents and 60-odd junior residents would be appointed across various specialities. \"The results of this decision could be doubly satisfying for us,\\'\\' said KC Rastogi, additional director, medical education UP. \"This will give a boost to undergraduate teaching on one hand, while on the other, the additional human resource will contribute in patient care as well,\\'\\' he explained.The deal would be lucrative for medicos too. The reason: medical education has a pyramidal structure. Number of seats for postgraduate teaching keeps on reducing and not every student is selected.\"But the work by a resident adds teaching experience to his profile and is quite useful at the time of selection for a job,\\'\\' explained Prof AA Mahdi, chief proctor, Chhatrapati Shahji Maharaj Medical University.Many medical colleges and institutions allow a senior resident to surpass lecturership and directly apply for the post of an assistant professor taking his teaching experience into account. And in case he is selected as a lecturer, he has fair chances of an early promotion.In another decision, the medical education department initiated proceedings for filling of vacant faculty posts in medical colleges. Officials said that 300 posts have already been filled through the UP Public Service Commission.\"There was a yawning gap between the required and available strength of teachers. But the process of bridging this is underway,\\'\\' said a government official.Another significant decision which is sure to add to the strength of teachers in medical college is government decision to adopt Medical Council of India\\'s (MCI) notification on age of retirement. To recall, in August last year, the MCI board had agreed that the retirement age of doctors should be increased to 70 from the existing limit of 65 years.The decision was notified in November 2010 and UP is claimed to be the first state to be adopting this.

All trials have proved it\\'s safe, that it has no side effects. May be they have to increase the dosage or tweak some things,\" she said.N Suresh, group editor of biotechnology publication BioSpectrum, said it\\'s possible that the particular trial methodology that Biocon adopted may not have worked. \"Now that they intend to partner with an international pharma company, the partner may have something that can provide different results,\" he said.Biocon CMD Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said on Tuesday that the company would continue the drug\\'s development and start discussions with a global pharmaceutical partner.Biocon has been conducting research and trials on an oral insulin candidate called IN-105 since 2001. Insulin currently needs to be injected by diabetics. But that\\'s an inconvenient way of administering it on a daily basis. An insulin tablet is a potentially transformative product, so Biocon has a lot riding on this product.Biocon said on Tuesday that in the Phase III trials, IN-105 did not meet the target of lowering the level of glycated haemoglobin by 0.7% compared with a placebo. The level of glycated haemoglobin in the body is an indication of the effectiveness of a drug to control blood sugar levels.The company indicated that the failure to achieve the goal may not have anything to do with the effectiveness of the drug but may have been the result of patients on the placebo modifying their behaviour during the course of the study. The suggestion is that those on the placebo changed their diet and lifestyle in a way that brought down their sugar levels. Such changes are sometimes attributed to inaccurate design of the clinical trial. Biocon also said that secondary targets on efficacy and safety had been met.Dr Vivek Shenoy, DGM in Biocon, said a failure in a clinical trial does not mean that the drug itself has failed. \"You learn from trials, and use those learnings to design a new trial differently, may be with other kinds of patients, population groups,\" Shenoy, who has been in the pharma industry in the US for 25 years, said.The future of the drug now seems to depend on Biocon\\'s ability to convince a global pharma major to bring in the money required to do international trials. Such trials will cost over $150 million, something that Biocon cannot afford on its own.Mazumdar-Shaw is currently in the US wooing partners. She disclosed the latest details of the oral insulin drug at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference that is currently on in San Francisco. Last year, she convinced global pharma major Pfizer to enter into a $350 million deal to market Biocon\\'s insulin drugs globally. Clearly, confidence in Biocon is high.Chaudhury of Frost & Sullivan says it\\'s a smart move to get an international partner. \"They will have to share the profits.

The direction is aimed at restricting the entry of pollutants in the river.A reality check by TOI on Monday not only exposed the ineffectiveness of the prohibitory orders, but the scene at various ghats clearly showed the fearlessness of the offenders.

Under the prohibitory orders, acts like bathing with soaps or bathing animals or washing clothes with detergents are restricted and indulgence in such them can attract penalty of Rs 500.As per ADM (city) AK Rai, efforts are being made to strictly implement the prohibitory orders and the respective police stations have been instructed to keep a tab on the practice that attempts to pollute the river. Some of the prominent ghats like Dasaswamedh, Rajendra Prasad, Panchganga and Asi have witnessed strict implementation of the law and their noncompliance have attracted a penalty and challan.While prohibitory orders and directives are in place, the tendency of natives to bathe in the river and washing clothes seems to have gone up. The winter season has caused acute power crisis and also forced people to use platforms and stairs of the ghats to dry their clothes.

We raised the issue of our girls with the previous government and the police on several occasions over the last decade. This phenomenon has been there because a minority of Islamic extremists view all \\'non believers\\' as legitimate targets,\" said director NSO Inderjit Singh.Targeted sexual offences and forced conversions of Hindu and Sikh girls was not a new phenomenon in the UK, said Ashish Joshio from Media Monitoring group.\"This has been going on for decades in the UK .

Although banks have started providing for a higher pension bill, setting aside the fund to meet the liability that arises over the next few years in one shot would dent their balance sheets.Around 3.3 lakh public sector bank employees are estimated to be eligible to get pension post-superannuation as part of a second option being given to them. A second pension option was part of the wage settlement agreed upon by banks and unions, which had capped the average pay increase at 17.5%. Earlier, they could only get provident fund. Among the public sector lenders, only the SBI group had the provision of giving pension to all its employees before the wage settlement.As per the pact , bank managements will provide 70% of the deficit, while the remaining will have to be borne by the employee. The United Forum of Bank Unions, which negotiated the wage pact and pension with Indian Banks' Association, had said that employees had to pay 2.8 times of their Nov 2007 salary from the arrears of the wage settlement.Banks are in various stages of getting a firm idea on the number of employees as several of them had given time until December for employees to opt for the scheme. Bankers, however, expected over 90% of serving and retired employees to opt in favour of pension.Lenders had taken up the issue with RBI last year, which in turn is discussing it with Institute of Chartered Accountants of India that sets accounting standards.

Efforts were made to ensure a balanced intake of nutrients in the soil to bring improvement in the quality of mustard oil after harvesting the crop. Now, with anti-oxidant properties and enhanced MUFA level, mustard oil could be easily consumed along with sunflower or soyabean oil, he added.Interestingly, after ensuring improvement in the quality of mustard seeds, the focus is now on increasing the productivity of mustard seeds in the region. Most of the mustard crop is grown in rainfed areas in east UP and average production of the crop hovers between seven to eight quintals per hectare, which is well below the national and west UP average of 10 to 12 quintals per hectare. The integrated nutrient management approach promises to increase the productivity, keeping it at par the national average besides improving the quality of soil through organic farming methods, said the principal investigator of the project.It is also worth mentioning that the country has already witnessed the maximum production of mustard seeds, touching the figure of 7 million tonnes this year.

Known for his links to a top politician from Maharashtra, Harshad also owns 12% stake in the Kochi IPL team.The list sports another Mehta clan, also a well-known diamond trading family, who started Mumbai\\'s Lilavati Hospital. The LGT account of Kirtilal Mehta, the family elder who died in early 90s, may have become non-operational. His children Prabodh and Rashmi also have accounts with the bank.Manoj Dhupelia, Rupal Dhupelia and Mohan Dhupelia, who figure in the list, are believed to be from a business family in Kolkata that is into import-export.The expose of the list has a mixed outcome for Congress. That it does not have anyone known for his links with Congress can be cited by the party to argue that it had no vested interest in keeping the identity of the foreign account holders under wraps. However, Opposition has seized upon media\\'s success in accessing the classified document to seek to ram home its point that the UPA regime is reluctant to release the names of the account holders.On Saturday, BJP kept up its chant that the government lacks the will to recover black money hoarded abroad.Black money has become a hot button issue. Government says it is hamstrung by the treaties with other countries as well as lack of such agreements. India has been holding Tax Information Exchange Agreements with 10 out of the 22 identified tax havens. They include Bahamas, Bermuda, British Virgin Island, Isle of Man, Cayman Island, Jersey, Monaco, St Kitts and Marshall Island. Efforts are on to seal similar agreements with the remaining ones which continue to attract illegal deposits from Indians.Some, including Liechtenstein, have refused. In fact, the information on LGT Bank accounts became available to India from the German authorities who bought it from a bank employee.Liechtenstein, Switzerland and others say that they will exchange information only in cases of criminality.On Saturday, Mukherjee pointed to government\\'s compulsions. \"The government, suo motu, cannot reveal the names because according to the treaty we can only use the information for taxation purposes,\" Mukherjee said. \"We can only reveal the details in the open court when the matter comes up for hearing,\" the finance minister further said.Traditionally, Indians have preferred tax havens in Europe. But with the old tax havens coming under pressure from the US and other G20 countries to disclose the names of those holding accounts, Dubai and Singapore have emerged as the preferred destinations.',\n",

What is needed is evolving new scientific methods to enhance foodgrains production,\" he said.The CM praised the efforts of Jyoti Devi of Fatehpur block in Gaya who has turned vast barren land into green belt with SRI technique and other indigenous methods. He said Jyoti, now JD(U)\\'s MLA from Barachatti, and other farmers like Ramsevak of Dobhi (Gaya) and Kisan Chachi of Muzaffarpur are role models who innovated new methods of farming and increased production.On this occasion, the CM announced the remuneration of agriculture experts would be hiked from Rs 8,000 to Rs 15,000 from new fiscal.

For introducing the eco friendly alternative for the first time in the country, Pokhriyal\\'s team even bagged the CSIR award for science and technology innovations for rural development (CAIRD) recently.\"It took almost six years for us to develop this formulation - acaricide - which is neither a pesticide nor insecticide and yet can efficiently protect crops from pests,\" Pokhriyal, who did his PhD on micro emulsion polymers from chemistry department in 2000, before joining Inter University Consortium for Department of Atomic Energy Facilities and later the Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL), told TOI.\"Our challenges were to come out with a product which does not damage the plant and is bio-degradable. Although there are a variety of sprays available in the market, they are not oil based. Pesticides which are generally used to kills pests even kill friendly pests.

And for this purpose, the CBI says, he pressed into service some of his key aides in the company who created several fake email IDs and were generating a huge number of mails from these IDs making even the so-called regular employees of Satyam believe that they were all real mails and also that the business these mails were referring to was real. Most of the business was being shown as coming from countries like US, UK etc. CBI says all the business was fake and the customers shown via these mails were non-existent.According to CBI, it was D Venkatapathi Raju, the trusted aide of Ramalinga Raju in the company's finance department, who created seven fake email IDs with their domains registered with Rediff in 2006. The necessary fee for getting these domains registered was also paid by Venkatapathi Raju only.The Rediff executive Lobo on Friday gave the trial court the details about the registration of the domains created with them and about the emails sent through them.Meanwhile, the deputy director of the enforcement directorate (ED), N Sridhar, told the AP High Court that they had powers to attach all such properties which were acquired with the proceeds of crime (Satyam scam). The possessor of such property need not be an accused in the main case, he said while opposing the moves of B Teja Raju who was challenging the dispossession proceedings launched by the ED. Teja Raju's Jubilee Hills residence was acquired by him with the dividends paid by Satyam in 2005 after the Prevention of Money Laundering Act came into force and hence his house was also liable to be attached under Section 5 of the Act, the ED said. If he had any grievance with the order of the adjudicating authority under the Act, he should go to the appellate tribunal meant to hear such appeals, Sridhar said.

But behind his smiling face, there was a regret too. \"I have never had a full meal in the last 26 years since I started riding,\" jockey Malesh Narredu had revealed.As surprising as it might sound, what Narredu stated is nothing extraordinary in the world of horse racing. In fact, most of the successful, even the not-sosuccessful saddle artists, have similar stories of their own. In India and throughout the world, a jockey\\'s preparations start much before the horses are taken to the track. All the jockeys compete to get the best mounts, so as to get the most number of victories.One of the main factors behind a jockey\\'s success, apart from his riding skills, depends on maintaining a light weight. This helps them in being able to ride horses which are handed out lower weights by the racing officials. Horses are allotted weights depending upon their previous performances. The weight penalty mostly varies between 47 to 59 kgs. It also includes the jockey\\'s weight plus the saddle which roughly weighs around 2 kgs.This makes it mandatory for a jockey to maintain their weight ideally around 52 kgs or less. As most of the jockeys are expected to be around 5 feet in height, they become prone to put on weight fast if their diet goes out of control.Though the struggle to maintain low weight goes on relentlessly, it gets worse as the race day approaches. \"I have been used to staying without food for days together to bring down my weight to the desired level for particular rides. Sometimes I have had to shed 3 to 4 kgs in two days,\" says Narredu. \"Sometimes I would survive on just a couple of bites from my son\\'s lunch box. That would be my only meal in a day.\"The wife of another legendary jockey, who has now become a successful trainer, once revealed that he never ate even when they would go out on dates. \"It was I who hogged while he would just have a fruit juice,\" she said.Controlling the diet is not enough, some jockeys even avoid drinking water. Irishman Christopher Hayes says he just had half-a-cup of coffee in the morning, on the day he won the main race of the current Mumbai season\\'s opening day. Many admit a 500ml water bottle is enough for a couple of days ahead of the race.Many jog around the race course track under the scorching afternoon sun in rubber suits. \"After returning from jogging in the afternoon, I get into my car which I park under the hot sun. I then close all the windows and spend hours there,\" admits one jockey.Some spend hours in saunas, to lose weight. Many admit to rubbing water on their bodies when they stop sweating after sitting in such saunas for a longer time. \"Inside the sweat box, at times when the dryness of the mouth becomes unbearable, we would sip a small quantity of water only to spit it out seconds later,\" reveals a jockey.',\n",

They usually have no one to tutor them at home. The sentences in English texts are usually long with high-sounding words, which the kids find difficult to learn,\" said Narayan Swamy, secretary, KPTA.INDIAN FLAVOURG S Mudambadithaya, coordinator of the textbook preparation committee, said that during a review it was found that the standard of language was a little high for the age of the students. \"Besides, the content was also difficult for children to understand. They did not have an Indian background, which made the cultural setting alien to the children, besides the language itself. This becomes difficult for children as they cannot relate to the content,\" he said, adding, \"Moreover, there are very few teachers who have the potential to teach the language. Many teachers, who have studied till B.Ed in the Kannada medium, are asked to teach spoken English.\"Mudambadithaya added that the committee, which is preparing textbooks for the academic year 2012-13, intends to give lessons an Indian flavour. There will be a variety of lessons with both Indian and foreign backgrounds.English still remains a subject that gives nightmares to many students of the state board.

For young Harshith, the New Year has started on a positive note as he is considered champion-material' by many coaches and game's administrators.Harshith has so far won two singles and four doubles titles in the talent series and has reached the quarterfinals in the super series singles segment.Harshith, who took up tennis at the age five, used to frequent the tennis courts at Vijayawada Club where his father Mr. Girish Jain used to wield the racquet more as a recreation. He (Harshith) used to watch me and showed interest and thus he was initiated to the game, said Mr. Girish. Harshith is a regular at the tennis competitions held in and around Andhra Pradesh. But now this young lad has reached a stage where he needs move to a city to further his prospects. He does not have a quality player to practice. He has to move to a place like Hyderabad to achieve more glory. Hyderabad has better infrastructure and also talented players to play with, said Mr. Girish. The formative years of Harshith as a player were hectic as he used to leave for Hyderabad on Saturday night for a day-long practice on Sunday at a tennis academy at Sindhi Colony.

He ensures they catch the eye-ball and so keeps changing the poems for the sake of novelty every day.The 51-year-old has been running a paan stall-cum-PCO booth in Laxmisagar for the past 17 years. His advocacy against gutka products is as old as his shop. Though it\\'s mandatory to put up a notice saying tobacco products are injurious to health, Parida has gone a few steps ahead. He displays dozens of poetry highlighting the ill-effects of tobacco.\"Selling tobacco is my profession. But I want to do my bit to create awareness about the evils of tobacco. Several people commit to me that they will quit gutka. Whether they really quit or just switch shop, I don\\'t know. I like to believe that they quit,\" said he.Parida, a father of three children, had relocated to the city in his 30s from Baharana village under Balikuda block in Jagatsinghpur district, in search of a better livelihood.

So some people are suffering from the ill-effects of smoking though they are not actually smoking,\" said Itishree Kanungo, project coordinator, VHAI-Aparajita.Doctors, however, said chewable tobacco products, such as gutka, are a bigger burden on health in the state than tobacco. Dr Sanjoy Panda, a head and neck oncology surgeon, quoted the National Household Survey and said Orissa is second after Bihar with the highest percentage of tobacco chewers. More than 57 per cent of households in Orissa chew tobacco.Dr Panda said, around 28 per cent of all cancer patients in the state have got the disease because of tobacco chewing. Smokeless tobacco users have an increased risk of oral cancer, he said.Notably, the Supreme Court on December 8, 2010, had banned gutka and paan masala sale in plastic sachets with effect from March 1, 2011, and also asked the government to conduct a survey on the harmful effects of such products on health and environment.Irrespective of what the government plans to do to address the issue of tobacco, Parida\\'s crusade against paan is on.',\n",

This is the moot question the Group of Ministers headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee will grapple with in its first meeting.The environment ministry has cautioned that the coal ministry has recommended almost mandatory clearance to coal blocks it allocates to developers and miners. The coal ministry\\'s proposal would land a fait accompli in the lap of the green clearance cells of the environment ministry.A high level source in the environment ministry said the coal ministry was dancing a policy tango. \"After it took the initiative to demarcate no-go areas with dense rich forests, it now wants to take two retrograde steps back -- do away with even the clearance processes that have existed since the 80s,\" he told TOI.The GoM would have two options. The first would be to go with the coal ministry, withdraw the no-go demarcation that keeps 8.11% and also get the laws changed to force green nods by default for entire coalfields. A more moderate option would be to revert back to original regulations. This would require the project proponents or miners to secure environment and forests clearances for each mining lease.The environment ministry would remain empowered under existing green regulations to still reject mining in these demarcated dense forests.The zoning was perceived as advantageous by both the coal and environment ministry initially because it allowed investors to be informed in advance of the red zones before investing and not after they had been allocated the lands. But several existing allocated blocks fell in the no-go areas when the exercise was undertaken.A Planning Commission committee then suggested that those whose blocks had fallen in the no-go zones should be given alternatives on priority basis.The coal ministry instead proposed that the entire environmental regime be rolled back. Though the no-go policy did not have legal backing, getting a near-automatic clearance for coal blocks would require amendment to the environment and forests laws -- something the Congress leadership might not be happy with considering they were brought in during the previous Congress regimes.',\n",

Three students were injured in the police action while five were arrested.The students-police clash began after nearly 50 ABVP activists locked the main gate. A few students climbed the university building and raised slogans against the university administration. The ABVP activists went a step ahead of NSUI students who also abused the V-C publicly.

However, the number of women attendees increased to 604 during 2010.Talking to TOI, programme manager of AIDS project Geetika said, ''A woman's body is more prone to STIs due to hormonal changes. Most of the affected women belong to poor or migrant families who were unaware of hygiene, apart from their husbands' dominance.''She said most of the the truck drivers, migrant labourers and factory workers made multiple illicit sex relations outside their families and acquired STI while having unsafe sex, spreading it further to their wives. ''Men are more dominant in poor families and can force their wives to have sex, further giving the disease to her. Females are not even aware that STD can lead to HIV and further could develop into AIDS,'' she added.''It's only when major symptoms of STD like itching, vaginal discharge, stinking of vaginal area, pain in lower abdomen and blisters occur that they visit the doctor,'' she said.The manager said it was important to educate women about these infections and the need to maintain hygiene.\",\n",

His elevation to cabinet rank did not come as a surprise, but his shift to the new ministry definitely came as one.''AI will get my fullest support. It is not a case for being declared sick,'' Patel told TOI.Observers say Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's decision to give additional charge of aviation to prominent Congress leader from Kerala Vayalar Ravi, is to prevent the national carrier from closing down.Ravi is a former trade union leader and has an understanding of how the public sector enterprises function.

Decisions like placing order for 111 new planes worth Rs 55,000 crore for an airline living in virtual penury; merging Indian Airlines and Air India and allowing foreign airlines to come in droves to India are seen to be the biggest reasons for AI's fall.

The VNN is not only keeping its eyes closed towards illegally plying rickshaws and fails to check whether they have procured a valid licence from this agency,\" she added.According to VNN authorities, all rickshaw-pullers need to register themselves at the VNN office for the authorisation of licence. There are around 13,000 licence holders in the city and this number has remained constant since 1994 as no new licence has been issued to rickshaw-pullers considering the increasing congestion in the already congested city. But, the non-authorisation of license to new cycle rickshaws has increased the habit of illegal permit in the city.According to Amar Nath Mishra, staff at licensing office of VNN, though new licences were not issued at Sigra office, some rickshaw-pullers often got their licence issued from the Cantonment Board and plied rickshaw in main city. It is not illegal but increases the density of cycle-rickshaws in the city.When TOI interacted with some rickshaw-pullers in Lahurabir, Chetganj and Sigra, only two of them had licence while the other five did not have the licence given by the VNN. \"I do not meet the age requirement,\" said Pradeep Kumar (15) while Tulsi, who was not sure about his exact age, came from Bengal and could not get a licence in city.\"We conduct drives to check unauthorised rickshaw-pullers. We have divided the city into five different zones, viz. Durgakund, Sigra, Cantonment, Adampura and trans-Varuna,\" informed Reeta Rani Vikram, licensing officer, VNN. According to Reeta, each day, about 50 unauthorised rickshaws were confiscated and brought to the VNN office at Sigra against a fine of Rs 50.\"The situation is worst with illegal immigrants coming from Bangladesh, Bengal, Bihar, and other areas. We are authorised to provide licence only to the domicile of Uttar Pradesh,\" says Reeta. Before the renewal of a licence, the person was asked for an identity proof like ration card, voter identity card and resident proof. Apart from that there are various other norms to comply with.According to Amar Nath Mishra, the age of the driver should not be less than 20 years and should not exceed 50 years and should be at least 5\"4 in height. After the completion of these criterions, a medical fitness check up is performed to see if the driver is suffering from any kind of heart, lung or other diseases and then traffic inspectors give training to these drivers on a daily basis to educate them about traffic rules. But there is no compulsion on the regularity and attendance of the rickshaw-pullers to attend the traffic education at VNN, leaving a major section ignorant about how to move on roads.',\n",

However, the energy crisis to a certain extent could be tackled by harnessing the Sun\\'s power.The UPNEDA exhibition at Bakshi-ka-Talab area had different solar-powered equipments on display. Solar water heaters, home lighting systems, improved version of solar cookers, solar lanterns, and solar inverters among others. The items displayed have been approved by the Solar Energy Centre (SEC) of the Union ministry of new and renewable energy.Solar cookers have two models. One model works entirely on solar energy, while the other has an electrical back-up. The cooker takes about one-and-half hour to cook food. During cloudy weather, cooking time may go up. The cooker comes at a price of approximately Rs 3,100. And, the one with an electrical back-up, costs approximately Rs 2,200. \"It preserves the nutritional value of food,\" said VK Tiwari, project officer, UPNEDA.The solar water heater was another product on display. The system would cost some Rs 17,500. People purchasing it get a subsidy of Rs 5,000. The heater has to be put at a place where it gets sufficient solar heat. It can heat 100 litres of water, up to 60-65 degrees, in six-seven hours. It has zero-maintenance and manufacturers also provide five-year warranty on it.The solar equipments designed for UP have a three-day power back-up, considering the state\\'s weather conditions. The solar products are popular in rural areas, given the fact that these areas do not have electricity or have prolonged power cuts. But, their popularity is still to catch up in urban areas. The major reason is the high cost. The solar panel and the battery increase the cost of equipments.The government offers a subsidy of about 30% on these products in order to make them a preferred one. The home-lighting systems have four models available, with one of the models also having a fan attached. \"The technology has been used to provide fans to traffic police at Hazratganj crossing,\" said Arun Kumar Srivastava, publicity officer, UPNEDA.Those willing to buy the products can get them at regional rural banks or directly from NEDA. Solar-powered inverters, fetching Rs 75,000, was also on display. Most of these products come with a five-year warranty period. And, the cost can be recovered in 2-3 years as it cuts down electricity bill. Government establishments like Railways are using the solar-powered equipments.

The module is being prepared for the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D).CDFD director J Gowrishankar said the detailed report would be of immense help to the police in collecting evidence from the scene of offence.The practice for investigating agencies is to send the samples for analysis to forensic laboratories anywhere in the country.

Given the increase in prices, the central bank has to be seen to be doing something to rein in inflation-and when it comes to inflation the only weapon in RBI\\'s armoury is interest rates. \"We expect a 25-basis point increase in interest rates,\" said O P Bhatt, chairman, State Bank of India, stating a view that is echoed by most other bank chairmen.\"The market has widely factored in a 25-bps increase by the RBI. Indeed, the spike in December 2010 wholesale price index inflation to 8.43% and the sharp upward revision of October inflation to 9.12% leave the RBI with little choice but to hike,\" said Standard Chartered Bank in a report. But there are equally sound reasons for the central bank to increase the supply of funds to the banking sector. The RBI, which is supposed to be the lender of the last resort, is lending around Rs1,00,000 crore to banks daily as a matter of course. The central bank had earlier indicated that a deficit of funds in the banking systems helps it better in controlling prices. However, it also said that a deficit of more than one per cent of bank deposits would be outside its comfort zone. Given that bank deposits are less than Rs 50,000 lakh crore, the current deficit is more than double of RBI\\'s comfort zone limit. SBI, the country\\'s largest bank, has been regularly borrowing from the central bank and most banks are unable to raise enough deposits to meet their lending obligations.Money market dealers expect that there will be some measures to ease liquidity. However, there is no consensus on what these measures will be. Some expect that the RBI will ease reserve requirements of cash reserve ratio (CRR) and statutory liquidity ratio (SLR). The CRR and SLR refer to the portion of deposits that have to be compulsorily maintained in cash deposits with the RBI and in government bonds respectively. Others expect that the central bank may decide to make more money available to banks by offering to buy bonds from banks that are short of funds.The RBI needs to keep the liquidity tap flowing also because growth is no longer at the pace it used to be. According to Bhatt, the country\\'s largest bank may not be able to sustain a 20% growth in credit until the end of the financial year. \"The surge in credit, which was witnessed in the third quarter, last year, did not happen this year. Also part of the reason for the strong credit growth in the third quarter was strong demand from oil companies because of the increase in oil prices,\" Bhatt added. He said the RBI will have to balance growth and inflation interests in its monetary policy.According to Standard Chartered, the RBI will have to extend tactical measures to ease liquidity. This is because the banking system is coming under strain as a large amount of money is being held in currency form and it is uncertain whether the government will release some cash from its surplus through spending.',\n",

Additional principal chief conservator of forest H S Singh said that of the 26 districts surveyed, 7 had over 30 trees per hectare while six had less than 10 trees per hectare, where Ahmedabad figured.The survey was conducted in 2004 earlier. However, Singh added that the total tree cover in Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar had increased marginally. The data released showed trees per hectare in the city increased by just 0.82 trees in 2009. The tree density in Ahmedabad was 7.33 trees per hectare in 2004 and this increased to 8.16 in 2009. In Gandhinagar, it improved by just 0.56 trees per hectare during the same period.Officials said there was a drop in tree density in Porbandar, Amreli and Dahod. The 2009 survey in Dahod saw a drop of 11.86 trees per hectare, which was the highest drop in the state.Forest officials said that tree cutting was rampant on Ahmedabad district outskirts as it was growing. But, some greening measures had been taken up and hence there was no decline. They further said that in Gandhinagar the tree cover was 58.26 trees per hectare but this had seen a negligible increase. Despite massive plantation taken up in the state capital, the increase in five years was marginal due to development.The rate at which the trees are getting chopped off is more than the survival rate in the new tree plantation programme. Forest officials said the high tree density was only because of the green patches in the Gujarat Ecological Education Research Foundation and the natural riverfront project, both of which are in Gandhinagar.',\n",

But I don\\'t know what these boys do after a three-week stint with these academies,\" Ghavri said on Friday.\"Practising in the academy is one thing, but the players\\' true worth is known only when they play competitive matches.

Kumar has issued a set of 11 rules that do not allow for the regularization of illegal floors or the filing of a police case.Failure to follow the rules would be treated as \"dereliction of duty\", the commissioner has said. The rules include1) Mukadams of the Building Proposal (BP) department must take daily rounds of their areas and report to the sub-engineer and assistant engineer about work done beyond approvals and the scope of the Commencement Certificate (CC).2) The BP sub-engineer should immediately issue a notice under Section 354A of the BMC Act to stop work in 24 hours.3) The BP assistant engineer should then seek the approval of the executive engineer and ask the concerned ward for manpower and machinery to do the demolition. Police presence can also be asked for. All this should be done within three to four days of the stop-work notice being served.4) There is no need to issue a notice under Section 53 (1) of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act, which gives the developer time to apply for the regularization of illegal portions. A police case also need not be filed.5) The developer gets just 24 hours to prove he has the permissions before demolition begins.6) Architects and surveyors of the erring developer face suspension of licences.7) In the case of wards, the demolition should be undertaken 24 hours after the assistant municipal commissioner gives his approval.8) In the case of occupied illegal buildings, notices should be issued under Section 351 of the BMC Act for wards and Section 353-A of the same act for building proposals.9) Only the court, additional municipal commissioner or BMC chief can halt a demolition.10) Failure to follow rules would be dereliction of duty.Approving authorities - executive engineer for BP and assistant municipal commissioner for wards - will be held responsible for not taking erring staff to task.Interestingly, legal experts said there are questions if the BMC chief\\'s circular, issued on Wednesday, would stand up to legal scrutiny as sections 52 to 54 of the MRTP Act lay down procedures for penalizing developers and regularizing unauthorized work. \"The order makes sense as it would act as a deterrent against illegal construction, but if challenged before the judiciary, it could fall flat on its face,\" said a legal expert.Till now, the BMC would issue a notice under Section 354 of the BMC Act and then slap another notice under Section 53 (1) of the MRTP Act. This tells the developer to restore the work to the original status, and also gives time to apply for the regularization of floors.',\n",

The NRLC had submitted an estimate of Rs 1.22 crore for the work. Chief executive officer of KVT SN Tripathi told TOI on Saturday: \"During November 3 meeting, the trust members found that estimate submitted by the NRLC was very high. After discussing the NRLC\\'s proposal and other aspects, the trust decided to prefer other options.\"The issue of threat generated for KVT\\'s architectural marvel had come to light when Shatrudra Prakash, the general secretary of the Citizen Forum and former UP minister, demanded a white paper on the application of enamel paint in 2008-09. The enamel paint on the walls of KVT, which enshrines one of the 12 Jyotirlingas of Lord Shiva, was applied five-six times in the past two decades. Due to it the artistic stone walls of this temple, built in 1777 by late Maharani Ahilya Bai Holkar of Indore, started decaying. The KVT\\'s dome was covered with gold donated by Punjab Kesari Maharaja Ranjeet Singh in 1839.After that the temple administration sought help from the Archeological Survey of India (ASI), which recommendation the KVTT to assign NRLC to examine the effect of enamel paint on the walls of KVT for the first time in July 2009. With the beginning of NRLC\\'s study, it surfaced that a blunder had been done to the stone walls of the temple. The porous stone absorbs water along with salt and mineral through capillary action. And, if coated with plastic paint, the stone does not allow moisture to go out, ultimately causing damage to the stone. After it the NRLC, a scientific institution of the Central Ministry of Culture dedicated to the conservation of cultural heritage, estimated a cost of Rs 2.19 crore for removing the enamel paint from the KVT walls.However, the trust considered this proposal as impractical due to the high budget and rejected it. After that the KVTT consulted institutions like state unit of ASI and the Dyes and Food Adulterant Texological Division, ITRC, Lucknow, but again the trust was asked to seek the help of NRLC. During its December 17, 2010 meeting, the KVTT asked NRLC to prepare a fresh study report and estimate. In March end, the NRLC submitted a new estimate of Rs 1.22 crore.But, whether the temple administration prefer to spend such a huge budget for this work had become doubtful before November 3 meeting of KVTT when the CEO of the temple had put an objection over the submission of an estimate of Rs 1.22 crore by the NRLC. The objection was made because the temple administration found that this study report the NRLC contained the methods for removing the enamel paints from the temple walls to check further erosion. But, Tripathi said, this study report could not make it clear whether the life of centuries old artistic stone walls of the temple would extend after the exercise of NRLC or it would become weak.\"The trust took this objection seriously during its meeting as the Tarkeshwar and Rani Bhawani temples had been renovated in the same architecture in which the KVT was built but at a very low cost. As the solutions against other problems being faced inside the temple\\'s sanctum sanctorum and decaying stones under gold plates resulting leakage, the KVTT found no reason to make such a huge investment,\" said Tripathi. He said the artisans who could remove the enamel paint by reviving the artistic walls would be found and engaged for this work.',\n",

This points to a loss of roughly Rs 9,300 crore per pan-India licence from spectrum sale under A Raja\\'s regime or a pan-India loss of roughly Rs 66,000 crore from 122 plus 35 dual technology licences alone. Add to this the loss from spectrum allocated beyond 6.2 MHz and the loss mounts to well over Rs 1 lakh crore. According to some operators, the report creates major discrimination between existing operators who contribute to 95% of the increased teledensity and the new entrants who own just 5% market share.Trai has also changed its view on its reasons for not holding 2G spectrum auctions. In 2008 it had argued the need for a level playing field while giving away roughly 660MHz of spectrum at 2001 prices through a first-come-first-served process. Trai now argues that auctions can\\'t be held because spectrum holding of 162MHz is simply insufficient.Trai data shows that in half of the 22 circles there is no spectrum to allow even a single new entrant to come in including in 9 circles where there is no spectrum available at all.However, Trai believes that if spectrum is returned from cancellation of licences from the 69 companies that it has identified for cancellation then auctions can be held. This is strikingly similar to the position announced by Sibal in his press conference of 29 January.Vodafone and Bharti have already condemned Trai\\'s recommendations, calling them flawed, illogical and discriminatory.According to Vodafone\\'s CEO, Marten Pieters, \"The sector has already been impacted greatly by the illogical difference in treatment of GSM operators and so called dual technology operators, the 2G scam as reported in the media and the impact of the auction of (artificially scarce) 3G spectrum. The Trai recommendations do nothing to resolve these issues but actually make them worse\".In a press statement, Bharti said, \"Trai has finally accepted the principle that ultimate discovery for the spectrum pricing should be through an open, fair and transparent auction. We welcome this recommendation. We, however, fail to understand the reason for linking the auction price only to spectrum beyond 6.2MHz. The price discovered through a fair and open auction must apply to all spectrum allocations. Spectrum is spectrum and there is no rationale for artificial distinction between spectrum up to 6.2MHz and beyond.\"',\n",

Part of a team of 15 `saffron maulanas\\', Chisti trudged the labyrinthian gullies of Machchali Mohal, Model Town and Baeesi Masjid -- all predominantly Muslim pockets in the city -- to introduce them to Sangh philosophy on Tuesday afternoon.The short high-pitched sales talk ended in waving of a slim booklet cataloguing the virtues of RSS. Each of its 24 pages marked the parivar\\'s angst at the `saffron terror canards\\' and misinformation campaign about Ramjanmabhoomi movement. \"Please go through it,\" Chisti would plead \"and let me know whether or not you agree with the sentiments.\" Incidentally, Chisti was roughed by Imam of Jama Masjid Maulana Abdul Bukhari when he suggested handing over \"the RJB complex to the erstwhile king of Ayodhya\" at a press conference in Lucknow some time back.The surprise visit, a part of the RSS\\'s ongoing Grih Sampark Abhiyan (home-to-home interaction campaign) led to varied reaction among the audience. Some like Mohammad Alam simply gaped at the gang in bewilderment. Meeraj Hussain gritted his teeth trying to control his outburst; Parveeen Abidi looked openly skeptical unlike her young neighbour Arshad Hussain, a student of Shia PG college, who declared that a friendly dialogue was welcome for whatever it was worth.In any case, Alam grudgingly conceded, \"it was the first time in the past 60 years that the lanes of Machchali Mohal had seen a khaki nickerwalla from close quarters, even though the nicker and Faiz cap don\\'t go together\".Leading the team along with Mohammad Afzal, national convener of Muslim Rashtriya Manch Vibhag Pracharak, Lucknow, Dr Umesh Kumar also offered a cautious line now and then. \"Most of the Muslim brothers are finding this an extremely stimulating experience,\" he declared. Donning his trademark copious khaki shorts, Kumar resolutely ignored the sniggers barbs or vibes that came his way.It is the first time so they are a little wary, he patiently explained, even as Mohammad Arif a particularly cantankerous subject loudly chose to question the credentials of Chisti and Co, or his neighbour used choicest expletives for one of the troupe members severely demanding the man be \"handed over to the police for promoting rabid anti-minority sentiments for the rest of the 364 days\".An unfazed Kumar determinately continued about the \"stupendous success\" of his mission instead. \"Over the past two days, we have already distributed 26,000 copies of the booklets,\" he claimed. Most of the recipients, he said, willingly paid Rs 5 as the contribution money. Even a Muslim pocket like this has earned us Rs 150, so one can imagine the response, he gushed.A rather strongly worded document, the booklet contains some interesting observations. Rahul Gandhi is particularly targeted for his statement quoted by Wikileaks. \"One feels like laughing when Rahul Gandhi weighs Sangh and SIMI in the same balance...leave aside Sangh the boy would not know the history of Congress or his own ancestors\".

The model needs to be reworked as inter-bank charges are very high,\" said chief PRO, WR, Sharat Chandrayan.Over three percent of card tickets per day are bought through ATVMS and four percent through CVMs. \"We are concentrating on CVMS and ATVMs as we have seen a growth of 25-30 % in the last year,\" he said. However, there are constant complaints from commuters about the machines being out of order. On Saturday both the CVM and the ATVM at Lower Parel were not functional.The mobile ticketing scheme would help local train commuters to avoid waiting in serpentine queues by buying their tickets before reaching the station. It was to be introduced on WR and materialize in the early part of 2009.One of the problems with the pilot project was that the initial settings were compatible only with mobile users who had GPRS, said WR officials. Another roadblock was that the commuter could send the text message anytime after entering the station which he could misuse by choosing the least expensive fare. With ticket checking during peak hours being difficult, the chances of such a commuter going unnoticed was high.Then there were talks of a six digit number at the booking office which would be displayed on a digital screen and keep changing from time to time. The commuter would have to enter this number and his destination to book a ticket before he enters the station. WR is now working on a scheme where mail/ express tickets can be bought through mobile phones.Meanwhile, the rapid pace at which technology has been growing has killed yet another project-having cyber cafes at major stations.

Another international school in the suburbs levies a weekly fee of Rs 30,000 for bus services. Penalty for a cheque issued by the parent being dishonoured is Rs 10,000 at some schools, the PIL claimed.Alleging that the extra amount charged under categories like admission fee, caution money, imprest money, technical upgrade are nothing but another form of capitation fee, the petitioner sought strict action against the schools.The PIL has demanded an inquiry into the financial affairs of all international schools in the state to verify the amount of capitation fee collected. The petitioner asked for a committee to be set up to scrutinize the accounts of all schools that charge over Rs 4,000 as tuition fees annually and to check if there was profiteering.The PIL urged action against schools that charge fees under non-definable categories like \"miscellaneous/activity/school essentials/hobby/other fees\".

And, positive factors in these markets are - low penetration levels and less dependence on loans.Maruti Suzuki, the biggest carmaker of the country, recorded almost 20% or one-fifth of its sales from non-metro markets in 2010, up from 3.5% about three years back. GM witnessed nearly 60% of its sales coming from these emerging markets.\"It has become a substantive and crucial area for us,\" said Mayank Pareek, managing executive officer at Maruti Suzuki. Pareek said that Maruti-which is already strong in the smaller markets-has been making further attempts to shore up its presence to ensure that it penetrates even the remotest of the areas. \"We are developing a database, mapping territories almost village by village to ensure that brand Maruti is available at almost anywhere in the country.\"Arvind Saxena, sales and marketing director at Hyundai India, also said the smaller markets were getting more and more crucial for car companies. \"Aspirations are fast growing in these areas, including the rural belts. Also, the roads are getting better, another factor that aids sales of cars.\" For Hyundai, small towns and rural areas (beyond top 40 cities) contributed as much as 30% to overall sales in the last year. This used to be around 18-19% around five years back. \"The numbers have been growing and now we are also expanding our network in these areas,\" Saxena added.A good monsoon and less dependence on finances are also factors that make the smaller markets, especially the rural areas, a reasonably fair bet. According to estimates provided by Maruti, about 63.5% of rural buyers purchase cars in cash. While 10% of urban households own cars, the figure is only 2.3% in rural and smaller towns.The insulation of the markets from other factors like stock market volatility also makes them a safe bet.

India\\'s decision to join the fray came after London withdrew its bid to host the match last week.Though the FIDE (world chess federation) had not confirmed the venue because the qualifying matches (Candidates phase) to identify the challenger to Anand were still in progress, the London organizers wanted an agreement to be reached by January 29, 2011.FIDE had its presidential board meeting in Turkey last weekend which was attended by All India Chess Federation secretary DV Sundar. \"The meeting did not discuss any bid in detail,\" Sundar told TOI. \"But we offered to host the match in India,\" added Sundar, who is also the vice-president of FIDE.London was projected as the city to host the match since 2009 but the sponsors found it difficult to finalize the deal with FIDE. At the moment, only Anand is the sure candidate for the match and his challenger would emerge from a series of Candidates matches to be held this year. \"FIDE can\\'t finalize any venue before the Candidates matches are over in May because the venue should be acceptable to the challenger as well. So the bids would be finalized only in May. Unfortunately, London said they could not wait that long,\" said Sundar.This is not the first time that Anand\\'s world championship matches have run into problems. The last championship match between Anand and Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria had sponsorship problems but then Bulgaria stood behind its candidate (Topalov) and offered the maximum bid to seal it.But this time the Indian federation seems ready for the big match. The last time the country hosted a world championship match in 2000 in New Delhi, Anand went on to win the title for the first time, though the final was held in Tehran.\"London has been a probable venue for the world championships since 2009 and the sponsors had shown keen interest in staging the event. I have not been involved in the negotiations so I can\\'t comment on what has transpired. The world championships in 2012 would be one of the most closely-contested matches, personally for me it would be a very big challenge,\" said Anand, who reached Chennai on Sunday after the Wijk aan Zee tournament.Anand\\'s wife and manager Aruna said Anand would be happy to play the match in India but she was not sure about the Indian bid. \"Anand has played three FIDE world championship matches in India and he has done well here. It would be a good challenge,\" she told TOI.If India finally gets the nod, Chennai is the city that looks likely to host the match.

When it came to technical malfunction, engine failure was a primary cause.Statistics showed that in most buses, especially those procured under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, either the engine was at fault or there was a fault in the fuel pipe (CNG system). Recently, a bus was gutted after a leakage in the CNG pipe.Last July, cases of engine breakdowns rose to 505 vehicles, while it was 428 in June. The figures declined, with 299 having engine failures in November. As far as the fuel pipe system was concerned, 308 buses came to a sudden halt in June, while 301 did in July and 360 in October. Brake system defects forced drivers to halt 165 buses last June. There were 163 such cases in November.Breakdowns due to starter problems or low battery led to passengers getting charged up against drivers/conductors. As many as 213 buses stopped in July and 123 had low/old batteries due to which they could not reach their destinations in November.Electrical faults led to 285 buses being sent back to depots in August and 213 in November . Air-conditioning units of King Long buses conked out in nine cases each in June, August and September , and in four cases each in July, October and November.BEST general manager Om Prakash Gupta said there was an improvement from September to November. Breakdowns went up to 4,475 buses in August but declined to 3,826 in September, 3,801 in October and 3,288 in November; 1,200 per month were for tyre punctures. Committee chairperson Sanjay Potnis said a reason for breakdowns was shortage of technicians /engineers.BEST may outsource staff to clean its 4,683 buses.The committee also cleared a proposal to sign a MoU with Mahagenco for 15 MW renewable energy (solar).

The CPR Environmental Education Center (CPREEC), along with Union ministry of environment, has restored 44 sacred groves in Tamil Nadu and the restoration of another eight is in progress.CPREEC director Nanditha Krishna said its mission is to restore a minimum of 10 sacred groves a year. \"Seeing the restoration methods, about 25 villages in the state have started restoring sacred groves by themselves. We always make sure that the local population is part of the restoration programme and also we get into a written agreement with respective villages, besides providing resources and assistance,\" says Nanditha, who is currently coordinating the restoration of a 300-acre grove near Madurai.\"Madurai Meenakshi Amman temple authority is the owner of that land.

While neighbouring district Kancheepuram has four sacred groves, Perambalur, Thiruvannamalai and Villupuram districts are way ahead by protecting 63, 47 and 34 sacred groves respectively,\" said Amirthalingam.According to Nanditha, the protection of sacred groves has become a major challenge now. \"As most of these dense plantation areas are attached to local deities that attract devotees, they are getting highly polluted by garbage and plastic wastes. Also, local deities are being replaced by popular gods, resulting in the construction of temples that disturb the original habitat,\" said Nanditha. She is in favour of legal protection for these sacred groves as they are to be protected for generations.For example, the main deity Manjaniswara Aiyanar in Puthupettai, near Marakkanam in the East Coast road, initially stood in the open space to be worshipped by the villagers. The deity was later shifted to a temple erected inside the habitat, after cutting several trees in the sacred grove.\"Sacred groves on the east coast region represents remnant vegetation, and most of the species in these habitats cannot be find anywhere else. Also, they work as water sheds and perform water harvesting by themselves that maintains the ground water level in the region,\" Dr D Narasimhan, associate professor of botany department, Madras Christian College, told TOI.

The grievance of the society is that the members of the society, who were employees of the Southern Railway and the Madurai Corporation respectively, had availed loans from the society and had not repaid them even though they had an agreement on deducting the loan amount from their salary at source.Despite reminders sent to the Southern Railway and Madurai Corporation, the laon amounts had not been deducted, and hence the petition. The Southern Railway stated that the railways does not authorise any of its employees to avail loans from banks and other agencies without prior sanction of railway administration. Whenever an employee seeks salary certificate for availing loan from any bank, it was stipulated by them in the salary certificate that the railway administration does not undertake the responsibility for recovery of loans from the salary of the employees or repayment of loans availed. It is also stated that the signature affixed on the loan form is not the authorised signatory for the railways.Further, there is no provision for recovery of the amount while settling the dues of any deceased employee. Dismissing the petition, the Judge further said the petitioner had not mentioned anything about such an agreement being executed by the Railways and the corporation. The Railways had stated that its authorized officers had not signed any such agreement and the railways does not bind itself to such deductions. Hence, the case does not stand. It is also not clear as to how the society can ask some employees to be associate members and start distributing loans and thereafter, find fault with third party employers for not effecting deductions.',\n",

He sees something with a faint glitter inside the tray, but this 12-year-old knows all that glitters is not gold.\"I have been doing this for a couple of weeks now.

We look for gold particles and sell it back to small-scale goldsmiths. It is not an easy job as sometimes the slush mixture contains broken glass, nails and other sharp objects discarded by people,\" said B Govindan, Surya\\'s father and himself a gold dust scavenger.The gold dust scavengers are a group of people who collect sewage and dirt from the drains in areas housing gold ornament designing units and then later sift through the dirt to locate small gold particles to sell them back to goldsmiths. A wooden tray is placed in slanting position into which the slush is poured. The water is collected in a metal vessel kept at the end of the tray. This water contains minute gold particles (if any) along with sand, pieces of wood, metal shrapnels and other particles which are then washed with acid so that its easier to further isolate the gold particles.\" If we are lucky each of us manage to collect 400mg to 500mg of gold dust.

At night they roam the lanes of RS Puram, Vaishali Veedhi, Kempatti colony and Ashok Nagar, digging out sewage dirt and transporting it to their scavenging site by bullock carts. The slush is then rummaged and silted by rest of the workers to locate the tiny gold particles. \"It is easy to do it at night as there is less traffic. We take turns in this collection routine,\" said Suresh Das, another scavenger.According to P Shantakumar, Managing Trustee of Thozhar Trust, involved in rehabilitation of weaker sections of the society, the gold scavengers are a neglected lot and nothing substantial has come so far to rehabilitate them. \"There are health hazards as these children and others are handling sewage water with bare hands and often has bruises on their hands and come in contact with a numerous bacteria and vectors,\" Shantakumar added.\"We have no other option at the moment.

It will be extremely difficult to run bullet trains on the Indian Railways tracks in the present condition, he said.Bullet trains are specially designed to run at a maximum speed of 250-300 kmph in foreign countries. Apart from a separate infrastructure, separate tracks are required to run bullet trains which are a substitute to air traffic in foreign countries. Moreover, no goods trains will run on the special tracks of bullet trains due to safety reasons which is not possible here as goods trains are the mainstay of the railways economy, Sahay said, adding the railways must build a dedicated corridor for running the bullet train between Patna and Delhi.According to Sahay, the railways will have to spend a huge amount to fulfil this dream project. It will have to meet various technical needs before launching bullet trains on the tracks, he said.According to sources, the railways has been running fast trains like the Rajdhani Express and Shatabdi Express at the maximum permissible speed of 140-160 kmph on certain routes. There are instances when accidents occurred due to higher than permissible speed of trains on the poor tracks, sources said, adding that the financially crippled railways cannot afford bullet trains for which a new infrastructure will have to be built.According to a Railway Board official, the railways is keen to run high speed trains on public-private partnership (PPP) basis. But there is no guarantee that the PPP mode would be successful in the country as many railway projects are still languishing for want of private ventures. Thus, the fate of bullet trains in the country depends on some select foreign private companies, he said.To run bullet trains, the railways will have to lay separate tracks of high quality. The entire route must be fenced and it has to be ensured that there is no railway crossing level on the route. It would require a minimum of Rs 10000 crore to build the required infrastructure, Sahay said, adding that the maintenance of bullet train locomotives and coaches is a costly affair.',\n",

A majority of these are situated in upmarket areas, and have been leased at throwaway prices for 99, 120 and 999 years. There are also cases where the lease period is never ending.In a bid to increase revenue and prevent acts of misuse, the civic administration brought a new lease policy in September 2008. According to the policy, the BMC would collect rents based on ready reckoner rates for leased lands. The new rents would be immediately applicable in 908 cases where agreements for lease were pending. For the remaining 3,266 lease lands, the civic body would be at liberty to terminate existing agreements in cases where there has been a change of use, transfer of rights to a third party, or redevelopment is under consideration. Arguing that these acts amounted to breach in conditions of lease, the civic body would make it mandatory for the lessee to ink a fresh agreement, which would restrict the lease period to 30 years and charge higher rentals. A higher transfer fee was to be collected in cases of transfer of rights to a third party. It said that the revenue collected from the lease lands would increase from Rs 1.39 crore to Rs 196 crore.Amidst opposition from the BJP corporators, the civic improvements committee and the general body approved the proposal.On August 18, 2011, BJP corporator Bhalchandra Shirsat, who is also the chairman of the improvements\\' committee, moved a motion for reopening and rejecting the proposal. He contended that implementation of the policy had adversely impacted the pace of redevelopment. He even cited a court ruling, which stated that the \"redevelopment or change of use did not amount to breach in conditions of lease.\" The general body accepted the argument and struck down the 2008 proposal. At that time, even Congress and NCP members in the opposition did not object.Municipal commissioner Subodh Kumar, who was against the 2011 move, referred the matter to the state government using powers vested in him. Arguing that the resolution was adopted without seeking mandatory remarks from the commissioner, Kumar urged Chavan, who handles the urban development portfolio, to intervene. Following Chavan\\'s directives, the UD department issued orders on November 9 terming the August 2011 resolution of the civic body as \"illegal\". With the civic body instructed not to implement this resolution, the 2008 policy came into force again.An ongoing court case in a related matter, however, could impact its implementation.',\n",

India is a power hungry nation and needs to switch over from its tremendous dependence on fossil fuels to alternative sources of energy like solar energy, bio energy and nuclear energy. This was stated by former President and nuclear scientist APJ Abdul Kalam in the city on Monday. He visited several institutions in the city and spoke to students and faculty. Though he did not wish to comment on shelving of the nuclear plant project at Haripur in West Bengal, he made it clear that we cannot ignore the importance of nuclear energy anymore.When asked if Bengal should go for a nuclear power plant, obviously alluding to the fact that the Left Front government could not take the Haripur project forward and the Trinamool government having shelved it, Kalam did not give a direct answer. He, however, made it clear that there is no option before India but to go out to produce nuclear power because it is the cleanest and greenest form of energy. The discussion obviously steered towards the nuclear power plant at Kudankulam, Tamil Nadu, which has been in the news because of protesters stalling work of building the plant over safety issues in case of an accident. \"The plant is completely modern and safe. I can vouch for that. India is a power hungry nation and 2000 megawatt of power would be produced at the Tamil Nadu plant,. We need it\" he said. Each state of the country emits at least 30 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. \"We have no option but to switch to alternative sources of energy,like solar energy, nuclear energy and bio energy\" Kalam added.The fact that Mamata Banerjee istaking her cabinet to the districts and trying to reach out to the people living even in remote areas of the state, has caught the attention of the former President. He called her effort \"interesting\" and lauded her effort by saying that while he had mostly come across politicians who operated from their respective cities, \"Your chief minister is actually taking her cabinet to the districts!\" A case in point is the CM\\'s latest announcement that branches of the state secretariat will be set up in the villages.Kalam was talking to students of St Xavier\\'s College on Monday morning at a programe called X-Talk, organized by the school of management studies of the college. Earlier this morning, he spoke to students and faculty of IIM- Calcutta and gave them simple mantras for success. It was here that he touched on the importance of nuclear power as an alternative source of energy for the country in the years to come, because it is green and clean. He did not wish to comment about him being frisked in the US.When asked to comment on whether vice chancellors of universities should be political appointees, Kalam said, \"It is expected that those connected with academics should only be concerned with academics. Their connection with politics is not desirable.\" He asked IIMC students to concentrate on making India\\'s wealth grow and multiply. \"You don\\'t have to worry about recession. India has a huge middle class with great buying power. We can stave such threats,\" he said.Talking about leadership roles that students should emulate, Kalam spoke about space scientist Satish Dhawan with whom he had worked closely for many years. \"When the 1979 rocket launch failed, he took the blame on himself but when it succeeded in 1980, he asked the team to address the media. A leader should rise to the occasion,\" Kalam added.Some students at St Xavier\\'s asked his opinion on the issues of corruption that are being raised against the centre, to which he said, \"You cannot expect the government alone to address such issues. Instead, it is children like you who can rout corruption at the roots. If you see your father or any family member resorting to corruption, raise your voice,\" he advised.At both IIMC and St Xavier\\'s, Kalam made students pledge that they would work towards becoming unique people from whom the country would benefit. He said that they should start with having a great aim and go all out to acquire knowledge and enrich themselves. They should also work extremely hard and overcome all problems.',\n",

Alarmed at the tardy progress, Azad has called a progress review meeting with the health secretaries of 21 states on November 17.A ministry official said \"Since very few states have informed us of the status of their screening programme, the review has been called. We will help states facing shortage of manpower with models which they can work on. We will also thrash out the problems they are facing in implementing the programme and why some states have refused to sign the MoU.\"He added, \"The best way to detect abnormal BP and high blood sugar levels is to conduct mass screening. This will give us a clear picture of the prevalence of diabetes in the population. The ministry\\'s screening project was to roll out in 100 districts in the 11th five year plan while the remaining districts in the country would be covered in the next five year plan. However, the programme is far from taking off in the way it was conceived.\"The ministry told states to set up non-communicable disease (NCD) cells at state and district level and cardiac care units, each of which to cost Rs 1.5 crore.\"We will take stock in the meeting how many states have set up such cells,\" another official added.According to Azad, hypertension and diabetes was found to be rampant in Bangalore and Chennai after the initial screening was conducted. He said, under the programme, 14% and 21% were found to be suffering from diabetes and high blood pressure, respectively, in Banglaore. In Chennai, out of three lakhs tested, 50,000 were found to be diabetic, and another 60,000 hypertensive. He described the early results as \"worrying.\"Going by the ministry\\'s estimates, 15crore-20 crore people were to be screened for diabetes and hypertension this year. Around 100 most backward and inaccessible districts in 21 states and urban slums in 33 cities  with a population of more than 10 lakhs - were selected.A ministry official added \"Such massive screening programmes needs to be done systematically and requires manpower. We made it even more difficult for us by choosing to roll it out first in backward areas.\"International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimates that India is home to an estimated 50.8 million diabetic, which is likely to increase to 87 million, or 8.4% of the country\\'s adult population by 2030.A recent study on the financial burden of diabetes on the common man had found that 60% of diabetics paid for treatment and management of the disease from their personal savings. On an average, a diabetic in India spends Rs 25,931 annually on diagnosis and treatment of the ailment.Extrapolating the figures, the study claimed that the nation would spend $31.90 billion this year on diabetes care alone.

It comes on the heels of a similar experiment by the Delhi government in 2010 during the Commonwealth Games, when the government had pushed for a single transit card.However, the concept couldn\\'t take off over the issue of revenue sharing between the various transport bodies involved.The urban development ministry, however, seems to be more upbeat about the fate of the common mobility card. Lohia said: \"The card will be integrated in phases. In the first phase, the card will simply be a cashless means of travel. Once the modalities have been worked out, integration of the card will be increased with the transport agencies, at which point revenue sharing can be discussed.\"In the present avatar, the card will allow a commuter to have access to bus, Metro or rail through a single card. Parking payments and even paying traffic challans through this card are being discussed as possible features, said officials. The individual transport agencies, like DTC and Delhi Metro, would then have to get the card readers and other hardware to enable the use of the common mobility card.The ministry is hoping that state governments will go ahead with the implementation of the card soon, so that cashless travel and a unified fare collection system can be established throughout the country. However, sources in Delhi government said that though a letter had been received from the ministry last week, it had yet to take any decision. \"The matter would need to be discussed and reviewed before it is implemented,\" said the government official.',\n",

Jyothy Labs, which is close to buying Henkel India, has discussed placement of shares at a price topping Rs 300 per share. The PE investor may acquire around 15% through preferential allotment and make the mandatory open offer for an additional 20% at a similar price, said sources directly involved with the process.Bain Capital, Carlyle Group, TPG Capital and Apax Partners are in the fray for one of the biggest PE deals in India\\'s fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry. This strong PE interest comes just as Jyothy is poised to emerge as a national player following the imminent acquisition of Henkel India.Jyothy may partner with the PE investor for the next phase of growth as well to turn around Henkel\\'s troubled Indian operations. The company also wants to pay off the Rs 600 crore loan it has raised from Kotak Mahindra Bank to clinch the Henkel India buyout. The promoters, led by M P Ramachandran, will hold a minimum 51% stake (down from the current 63%) after the private equity transaction, which is likely to be sealed within three to four months.A crucial board meeting of Jyothy Labs is scheduled for Thursday, which will also discuss PE fund-raising plans, besides the Henkel India buyout which is expected anytime. A Jyothy Labs official confirmed talks with few private equity players for selling a significant minority stake. \"We will be finalizing the structure of the transaction shortly,\" he said, without getting into specifics.Although Jyothy has sought the life-time high stock price of Rs 330 per share from PE investors, a deal is more likely to be sealed at around Rs 300 per share. Apax Partners started talking to Jyothy for a potential deal in January this year but has been challenged by its global peers with aggressive price offers. \"This (PE investment in Jyothy) is an opportunity for a fairly large deal in FMCG which is rather rare. Besides, private equity interest in the sector has revved up after Actis made good return on Paras Pharma recently,\" said a private equity source who did not wish to be named.Jyothy has already acquired 14.9% stake in Henkel India from A C Muthiah of Spic. It is set to announce acquisition of Henkel AG\\'s 50.97% stake at Rs 20 per share.

The medical staff in districts would hold camps at block levels as part of the programme.In the initial stage, Bhilwara and Jaisalmer districts are taken up for free diabetes screening. As the medical, health and family welfare department does not have the required staff for door-to-door screening for diabetes, it started conducting the screening at the primary health centres and community health centres.In the next phase for the diabetes, five more districts would also start free screening of the disease. Among these districts are Jodhpur, Barmer, Bikaner, Nagaur and Sriganganagar.A senior official said, \"We have distributed free glucometers and stripes for the purpose.

       " '58f83cfe7be9e078c98bc455': 'MADURAI: There is water everywhere in Madurai city and its surroundings, but sadly, lack of efforts to store or conserve it have affected the water situation now with the corporation having been expanded by 100 km this year. Maintenance of existing tanks is the only way the city can withstand another expansion in 2030 or 2040, feel experts.Madurai is a place that is surrounded by tanks, many of which have been encroached upon by buildings unknowingly and on purpose, as the real estate business grew. About 20 years ago, it had 46 irrigation tanks, which have now been reduced to less than 30, with the Madakulam and the Vandiyur being the major ones that need immediate attention. Some of them like the Villapuram tank, one of its kind in terms of size, have today disappeared owing to encroachments.Speaking to The Times of India, J Kanagavalli, project coordinator of Dhan Foundation, who has been working on tank restoration and water conservation in many parts of Madurai, said that almost all tanks in Madurai had a well mapped out cascading system when they were formed in the past, but now all tanks as well as their feeder channels have been encroached.Most of the tanks in the northern and southern parts of the city had shrunk into mere pools due to encroachments. Major feeder channels such as the Kiruthumalnadhi channel, Thuvariman canal, Madakulam canals, Chinthamani canals and the Avaniapuram channel have all been transformed into garbage dump yards.The existing tanks are the last solution to the increasing population of the city. Most places in Madurai such as Anna Nagar have their groundwater table touching an all-time low of 600 feet in many places. If tanks like the Vandiyur continue to be encroached upon and remain undeveloped, an irreparable water crisis will hit the city in coming years. To restore them, one of the major steps to be taken according to Kanagavalli is the fencing of tanks to prevent pollution in the form of garbage dumping and also growing trees around to create a better microclimate. \"De-silting the tanks and trying to restore them without addressing the pollution issue will be useless because it will only lead to poor groundwater quality in the entire area recharged by it,\" she said.The Vandiyur tank originally had a capacity of 106.03 tmcft, which has now shrunk to a mere 66 tmfct, one reason being the fact that its ayacut which had been 961.91 acres has now been reduced to 636.26 acres. Temple tanks such as the Mariamman teppakulam, spread over 22.97 hectares, measuring 1,000 feet in length and 950 feet in breadth has the capacity to store 0.24 million litres of water, but today it is bone dry. Similarly, temple tanks in the heart of the city such as Koodalalagar tank, which can be easily recharged by simple measures such as diverting roof water to it during rains, is one of the most neglected tanks in the city.Already, thousands of acres of paddy fields have been converted into real estate plots, because farmers, stake holders in irrigation tanks, have given up on them. S Senkalai from Karupayoorani says he remembers his family cultivating on thousands of acres near the Vandiyur tank, and his grandfather would personally cut away thorns growing near it. \"But now even I have lost interest due to poor water availability in this tank,\" he said.Periodical announcements of moves to restore these tanks still remain on paper, with no concrete efforts being taken. For almost 10 years, the government has talked about a walkers\\' park along the banks of the Vanidyur tank and an island within, but it has not materialized.Professor S Chandran, convener of the environmental panel, Confederation of Indian Industry, Madurai zone, said all the tanks had been formed naturally with people cutting the channels for their convenience. Today the city has been expanded from the earlier 52 sqkm to 147 sqkm. If the next expansion comes in the next 30 years, the existing water bodies are going to be the only solution to the city\\'s water needs. \"Nature, at no cost, should be confined within administrative boundaries and reversing nature is becoming an impossibility. So, a legislation is a must to protect existing water bodies, which are less than 10 at present,\" he said. Professor Chandran says it is pertinent that the corporation forms a technical committee to address issues relating to tanks. Stakeholders have to be roped in for this and a lot has to be learned through success stories like \\'Siruthuzhi\\' in Coimbatore, he added.',\n",

While Lord Shiva is prayed in the form of 'Shivling', Shankar is the lord, it was stated.The residents were also informed that the reason Shivratri is celebrated at night is because Lord Shankar takes all the darkness from the life of a person and Lord Shiva fills it with light.Hardip Singh Nagi, a follower, said, ''People from across the world worship Lords Shiva and Shankar in their own traditional way.

Both, \\'Taare Zameen Par\\' and \\'Three Idiots\\' had passed a message to parents never to underestimate their child or compare them with others. Sadly, the movies have failed to educate the parents, teacher and the society at large.This ishappening even after the central government has revamped the entire education system, even abolishing exams for Std X. Undoubtedly, the tendency of the students to end lives over petty reasons is showing an alarming rise.\"Don\\'t make your child a coward,\" says psychologist Dr Anupama Gadkari, squarely blaming parents and teachers for making them fragile. \"Their tolerance level is going down due pressure from parents and teachers. They\\'re not habituated to hear \\'no\\'. Make them stronger to face problems, don\\'t shield them all the time.\"Former Shivaji Science College principal Namdeo Saste feels that students are frustrated as they do not have anyone to listen to. \"Break up of joint families and emergence of nuclear families is compounding the children\\'s problems. With both parents working, they have no one to speak to. In joint families, they had grandparents or other family members to talk to.\"He adds that in nuclear families, especially nowadays, when there is only one child in the family, the children are prone to frustration and pressures of study. \"Sadly, parents don\\'t have time to talk to them. They just expect cent per cent results from their wards without listening to their problems,\" Saste laments.Career counsellor Dr Pravin Bhatia advises the parents not to compare their wards. \"Only scoring good marks can\\'t be criteria for growth. If you see old geniuses who had made their mark, you will find that all of them used their mind in a creative manner. They were never good in academics, but they used their mind to achieve greatness.\"He asks \"parents and even teachers to take care during exam season\". \"Don\\'t always discuss studies and papers with them. Try to divert their attention and keep the atmosphere lively,\" says Bhatia.Gadkari however feels that even societal pressure is responsible for children committing suicide. \"Only parents can\\'t be blamed. The structure of the society is such that even relatives and neighbours put lot of pressure on the children. Everybody should have realistic expectations, even the students themselves,\" she said.The well-known counsellor adds that it\\'s up to the parents to make their wards strong. \"Today\\'s parents lack knowledge about parenting practices. They should read or learn how to treat their wards and more importantly learn to say \\'No\\' to their unnecessary demands,\" stresses Gadkari.Saste, on other hand, believes that the growing influence of western culture is also one of the factors for students ending their lives. \"You can see how boys and girls, even in schools, are in an affair and even an argument can upset them. This disturbing trend is on the increase. Teachers and parents should continuously talk to the students during exam time and inspire them to give their best instead of expecting them to score cent per cent marks.\"Arindam Sarkar, a student whose close friend and room partner Suradeep Bhattacharya hanged himself on Tuesday, called on the colleges to regularly conduct counselling sessions for all students. \"In their teenage days, students like us come across many ups and downs. They refused to share it apprehending loss of reputation or embarrassment. We should have a platform where we could share our personal problems apart from studies,\" he says.',\n",

About 60-70% of cargo moves on NHs. Consequently, a crackdown on overloading on these stretches will send a strong signal to the offenders.Joshi said a pilot project on electronic surveillance of truck drivers would be launched shortly to check malpractices.In a significant departure from his predecessor Kamal Nath\\'s policy, the minister said he would not like to set bigger goals and end up achieving little. \"Let\\'s have realistic goals that we can achieve.

And, interestingly, there were more takers for silver.According to jewellers in the capital, Akshaya Tritiya, which used to be more about buying gold, witnessed increased purchase of silver in its pure form.\"People are buying silver this time as well. The demand for silver on this Akshaya Tritya has doubled as compared to last year,\" said Pawan Jhalani, president of Sadar Bazaar Jewellers Association.\" And these sales are more for silver bars and coins.

The focus is more on investment,\" says Gobind Kishan, a trader at Vishesh Jewellers.Despite the slump in prices of both metals, demand remained unaffected on Akshaya Tritiya.

He has also indicated his unavailability for any other public office although he was seen as a candidate to replace ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet, who retires at the end of October.The reports said Weber has made up his mind to swap his present job for a career with Deutsche Bank, where he is tipped to share the post of management board chairman together with Jain, who in July last year took over as the head of the banks investment banking division. Jain also manages Deutsche Banks global markets division.Although the Josef Ackermann, chairman of the management board retires only in early 2013, the issue of his successor has raised huge debate.

He sought a stay of the HC order.But, the bench was angry with Rao for seeking a blanket ban on mining without providing it with the sketches, charts and data to qualify the alleged encroachments.Looking at the spread of the malaise, the bench set up the inspection team saying the data presented before it by the CEC needed re-verification before passing a restraint.The team would consist of senior officials of the forests, mines and geology departments of the Karnataka government besides a representative each from the Lokayukta, the CEC, and the lease owner. The demarcation would be carried out in their presence.In the event an illegality was recorded against a lease owner, the latter would have an opportunity to contest the ban in the Supreme Court but would have to forthwith stop exploration of minerals, the court said.The rampant illegal mining in Karnataka was first highlighted by Justice Hegde, who had regretted the brazen manner in which iron ore was extracted throwing the law to the winds.',\n",

The railway staff, grouped together as special task force for the purpose, caught people littering, smoking, spitting or peeing at the Charbagh railway station.Since March 6, 2008, some 5,000 persons were punished under the drive and Rs 31 lakh has been realised from them as fine. Being a revenue-earner for railways immediately after it was started, the drive had lost steam over these years. It was re-launched on Thursday.So, those visiting the station, beware. While you almost unmindfully start smoking at any of the platforms, a gang of railway men might swoop down on you and charge Rs 200. Besides, those littering the station by spitting and strewing garbage will not only be asked to clean the spot, but also shell out a fine of Rs 100.The action will also be taken against unauthorised vendors and people without platform tickets, who roam aimlessly. \"If it is the responsibility of railways to keep station clean, it is the moral responsibility of passengers to maintain it,\" said Amitabh Kumar, station manager, Lucknow.The parts of the station like circulating area, sub-way and second class booking hall are the places from where maximum people are caught. \"We mostly counsel people and let them go, but when they start arguing we slap a fine,\" he said. The informative boards have already been installed at the station telling people not to litter or smoke.It is true, however, that slackness on the part of the rail staff to continue with the drive has almost undone the impact created by it when it was launched.',\n",

Similarly, more ponds would be constructed under MNREGA scheme and plantation drives would be taken effectively.It may be recalled that since June 2001, the ministry of urban development has made rainwater harvesting mandatory in all new buildings with a roof area of more than 100 sq metres, and in all plots with an area of more than 1,000 sq metres, that are being developed.Besides, the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) has too made rainwater harvesting mandatory in all institutions and residential colonies in notified areas in metro cities.The CDO, meanwhile, said that from the next month, saplings would be taken from nursery for plantation purposes and authorities concerned must initiate corrective measures in the same regard. Besides, officials are being briefed about the low cost structure for the rooftop rain water harvesting and people should be make aware about the water conservation.Under the programme, apart from 20 blocks of the district, urban areas would also be covered and positive approach of every individual can take the issue in a right direction.',\n",

This waterways grid can be created at a height of around 250 meters above sea level so that it becomes a single horizontal plane, which connects all rivers at the same plane, facilitating a water feed or withdrawal from any part of the grid.\"The salient feature is that the large rivers need not be linked at the lower reaches, where the river is wide. Instead, rivers are linked in the upper stretches where they are connected with their tributaries,\" he added.They suggested that under the Networking of Rivers in Tamil Nadu, known as the Tamil Nadu Smart Waterways Project (TSWP), the special feature of the project was to retrieve only floodwater, which otherwise goes to the sea unutilized. The aim is to store and distribute floodwater to needy areas. It does not interfere with the utilizable flow (water available at 75% dependability) in any basin. Networking of rivers in the state will help mitigate drought by diverting flood water to any other needy basin. It is designed as a flood harnessing facility to enhance irrigation. A major advantage of this proposal is that there is no pumping anywhere in the whole system.Kamaraj said the Smart Waterways Project serves as a storage reservoir and contains floodwater. It facilitates two-way flow and allows inter-basin transfer without affecting the existing system. It proposes to connect rivers and lakes and tanks such as poondi, cholavaram, redhills, chemparampakkam, veeranam and Ramanathapuram.Suggesting that it could be used as an alternative for networking of rivers in the entire country, they said at present, there was heavy flooding in many rivers such as the Amaravathy, Vaigai and Noyyal. The Mettur dam will also have a water surplus shortly. Unless this water is stored, it will flow into the sea, causing heavy damage on the route. A study shows that every year, 177 TMC of water goes to sea unutilized in Tamil Nadu alone.Since the present government has announced such a project in their election manifesto, they urged the Government of Tamilnadu must take up the project immediately without any loss of time to minimize Flood damage, to increase irrigation area, to provide drinking water to millions, to create enormous employment opportunities and to meet the ever increasing energy requirement',\n",

The list of officials whose children work with airlines include two joint director generals, A K Sharan and Charan Dass. The post of joint director general is second only to the top post, that of the director-general.

Of the five subjects that CPL aspirants need to clear to get a licence, Rashmi Sharan had cleared three by sitting for special exams, despite not being eligible to appear for these. A K Sharan was also instrumental in issuing a Flying Training Organization approval to the flying school from where she underwent her flying training. The approval was given though the school did not have even a single aircraft at its base when the DGCA officials visited the school for inspection to issue the training school approval. The DGCA norm is that flying schools should have a minimum of three aircraft to get a flying training approval. Rashmi Sharan joined the flying school a month after it began functioning in August 2007. Even after it procured aircraft, the school lacked basic, mandatory infrastructure like hangar, rooms at its airport base for breifing/de-briefing cadet pilots before and after flights and so on. \"The leadership in DGCA felt that Sharan\\'s case is worth further investigation,\" said an aviation source.Last month, R S Passi, director air safety, was relieved of his duties following DGCA investigation which found that his daughter, Garima Passi, despite being poor in practical flying was recruited by SpiceJet under \"extraordinary circumstances\".

Thanks to this high amount paid by industrial units, the electricity bills of the common man remain within affordable limits.On Wednesday, the Bombay high court rejected Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL)\\'s demand for an interim relief to stop Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) from granting open-access licencethe licence to buy power from any agencyto industrial houses without recovering cross-subsidy surcharge from them. With the HC rejecting MSEDCL\\'s proposal, MERC will be able to continue offering open-access licences to commercial users till a further order is passed, which may take six months or more.Following the HC order, commercial users will have the option of continuing to buy power from agencies outside Maharashtra that offer electricity at a much cheaper rate than the suppliers in the state. If the 15 lakh industrial and commercial users, which pay the state over Rs 4,660 crore more than the actual tariff, start buying cheaper power from outside, suppliers in the state will not have the option of overcharging them and use the balance to \"subsidize\" the bills of residential consumers.In fact, residential consumers pay an affordable power bill as commercial users shell out cross-subsidy surcharge. Now, with the industrial units getting MERC\\'s nod to buy cheaper power from outside, experts fear that the subsidy burden of around Rs 600 crore (Rs 60 crore-70 crore per MW) will be passed on to residential and agriculture consumers (who usually use up to 300 units per month), pushing their tariff up to unaffordable levels.MSEDCL is not happy with the HC order. \"The Electricity Act, 2003, supports open access but it also asks for recovery of surcharge equal to the level of cross-subsidy from industrial consumers opting for such a facility. However, without recovering any surcharge, MERC has approved the plea of Indo Rama and other industrial houses to grant them the nod to buy power from outside. This will have an effect on otherconsumers,\" an MSEDCL lawyer said.However, MERC called MSEDCL\\'s belief baseless. \"Inefficient functioning of the petitioner has resulted in higher distribution losses.

The situation is no better at other nazool properties, including the heritage building housing the Jodhpur collectorate and the Sajjangarh Fort among others.While the City Palace houses a museum and is supposed to be a heritage building, it has been used as government offices with over 15 departments -- the police and the courts. And the damage is for all to see.The 18th century structure is littered all over with paan stains on the walls, graffiti in the staircases and seepages from overhead water tanks making the walls weak. The museum in the Palace is also in a pitiable condition.The government seemed to have turned a blind eye when this heritage structure is the USP of the state and the tourism department, one of the largest revenue earning industry.At the Jodhpur collectorate and the Sajjangarh Fort, the walls are drilled to fix cloth lines and other modern amenities such as air conditioners, geysers and water coolers.\"These heritage buildings are not made for housing offices. Because the rooms are large they have to be partitioned which not only defaces the historic ambience but in the long run causes immense damage to the original structure,\" a conservation specialist lamented.Sadly, the Government hostel\\', the oldest heritage hotel that would now be renovated to house the police commissionerate, suffers the same fate. The Khasa Kothi, historically a guest house for the royal family, fared no better and it that would be made operational for over 150 tourism officials.\"It was not even one year back that 350 officials of the Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation (RTDC) moved in here bag-baggage from the Swagatam building near the railway station.

Yet, several properties across Rajasthan are being ravaged by government offices,\" a source said.And with little accountability and interest by government officials towards preserving the structure, soon the heritage tag, would only be limited to private players, the source said.There are about 160 nazool properties in Rajasthan and only 35 of them are with the department of tourism.\"When the Government Hostel was transferred to the tourism department, it was functioning as a hotel with 40 rooms and that is how they were supposed to maintain it.

The lack of support, feels the team, has frustrated the audit effort. The fact came to fore in a letter written by CAG\\'s head in state Mukesh P Singh to nodal officer Sanjay Agarwal who is coordinating with the team on behalf of the UP government.CAG team says that the response has been equally disappointing at all levels - district, directorate and government. Singh\\'s letter states that none of the audit queries issued at the secretariat level were answered. Chief Medical Officers did not furnish 90% of the information asked for and remained especially reluctant when it came to furnishing records relating to budget expenditure. Large number of queries and observations remained unanswered at the level of directorates and State Programme Management Unit.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probing the case had a similar complaint. Taking note of the CBI\\'s complaint, Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court directed UP government to take the job seriously. In response, principal secretary, health and family welfare department Sanjay Agarwal wrote an eight-page letter claiming that they had provided what ever documents they could while assuring their support. In its response on November 8, the CAG team said that both the claim and assurance were futile.Contents of Singh\\'s letter reveal that lack of support worried the auditors since the beginning. On August 2, CAG sent an 11 page list of records and 52 page formats of information which were required for initial stage of audit and its planning. The CAG team wanted this set of information to be made available within a week so that auditors could get down to work on arrival. Though information was provided, it was incomplete and unauthenticated.The fact was communicated to the government on August 10 but this didn\\'t help the team. No progress has been made on the count even now as the date for field work is about to end. \"The 52 pages of formats in which information was asked was very basic and should have been just a click away with any reasonable organization as a part of its routine everyday working and programme implementation,\" stated an auditor.Auditors also contest the claims of the UP government that it had provided information on \\'most of the counts\\'. For example: In a meeting between CAG and state officials on August 19, the government assured to provide information relating to state health society and family welfare directorate. While the state government (page 2, para 3) claims that it provided the information, CAG replied that promises were made but not fulfilled. Auditors mentioned that information was not given despite reminders. \"Four reminders were given to the UP government but they could not churn desired information,\" sources in CAG told TOI. This is not for the first time that CAG team has expressed unhappiness over the lack of support. Singh wrote a letter to chief secretary Anoop Mishra in the last week of October accusing senior bureaucrats, particularly district magistrates, and health officials of not supporting them in the audit. The letter said that less than 10% information had been furnished and CAG was surprised by the attitude of district magistrates (DM) who have also not been \"forthcoming\".The same issue cropped up on August 28 during a meeting of state government officials with the CAG team. This one, however, related to CMOs and other health staff. At that time, the state government had assured that this would not happen again. But the matter was not sorted and Mukesh P Singh had to write to chief secretary on September 6.So, does the state government want to delay the release of the report in wake of assembly elections. Or announcement of a CAG audit was simply a posturing to avoid further bashing up by the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court which has reprimanded the state government several times on the count. CAG began its work on August 8 after dividing UP in five zones and randomly selecting 24 districts from these pockets.Chief Medical Officers did not furnish 90% of the information asked for and remained especially reluctant when it came to furnishing records relating to budget expenditure.',\n",

The GoM has taken this decision, keeping in view the public sentiment.\"Ramesh had visited the site in July and found that the local population and the elected representatives, including the Madhya Pradesh chief minister, were opposed to the Pithampur idea.The options before the GoM, headed by home minister P Chidambaram, include incinerating the waste in cement plants, burying it in the Union Carbide complex, shipping the waste out of the country or using DRDO\\'s Nagpur facility meant for hazardous waste disposal.

Although the distance can easily be covered in one-and-a half hour, Sethi does not want to take a chance. Reason: Regular and prolonged traffic jam caused by an unregulated toll plaza near Nawabganj.Commuters squirm as they approach this spot. \"But one cannot do much about it. You are really lucky if you do not find a jam that is likely to delay your journey by more than two hours,\" said Sethi, who owns a pharmaceutical unit in Kanpur\\'s Panki area.Situated almost 40 kilometres from the state capital, on a four-lane national highway (NH-24), the make-shift toll plaza has two gates on either sides of a divider. While the movement of vehicles coming from Lucknow happens to be smooth, all is not well on the other side. Long queue of heavy vehicles welcome commuters coming from Kanpur, as one gate often remains closed, allowing restricted movement of vehicles.The situation worsens after 10.00 pm, when movement of heavy vehicles, usually carrying maurrang and sand, is allowed. By midnight, hundreds of such trucks pile up at the spot, leaving commuters to face a tormenting time.\"I once missed a flight because of the delay at the toll plaza,\" recalls Saud Hashmi, a tannery owner in Kanpur. Hashmi started his 80-kilometre journey from Kanpur three hours before his scheduled flight was to depart. It was well a calculated time that eventually proved wrong as Hashmi bumped into the massive jam that did not ease out for nearly one-and-half hour. He missed the flight - and a crucial day, as well.Advocate Pankaj Sharma too recalled how once an ambulance carrying a patient to SGPGI in Lucknow got stuck in a jam, which was caused after an overloaded truck faltered near the toll plaza. Within 15 minutes, hundreds of trucks, buses and cars got stranded.\"Some of us tried to clear the way, but it was useless,\" he said. It was only after much persuasion that some vehicles gave side to the ambulance, which then sailed through. \"But even that took at least half an hour. I do not know what happened to the patient, but his family members were terribly upset,\" Sharma said.Authorities of the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), however, have no qualms about the issue. \"Tolling indeed causes traffic jam. It happens where ever there is frequent movement of vehicles, especially in the night,\" said NHAI project manager, Pawan Verma. He admitted of receiving complaints about the spot in the past also. \"But what can we do?\" he questioned.Unnao district traffic department officials say that they have deployed cranes near at the toll booth. \"People should inform us whenever a jam is caused by improper functioning of the toll plaza,\" said SP traffic, Prem Narain.The four-lane spruced up road between Lucknow and Kanpur was supposed to considerably cut down the travel time between the two cities. That, frequent travelers would tell you, is not the case. The total time taken to cover the 80 km distance should not be more than 90 minutes. But often it stretches by more than three times. The most obvious reason for this, especially during the night, is the rickety toll plaza halfway through the distance which has not been made fully functional. Authorities cannot shrug off their responsibility by saying that toll plazas are known for traffic jams. If all the counters at the plaza are not functioning, one cannot expect the traffic to be smooth. Lucknow-Kanpur Road has been a work in progress for nearly a decade. Now, when the construction part is almost over, the NHAI must ensure that procedural roadblocks are done away with.',\n",

But ever since the power crisis, production has gone down by 20%. In addition, the prices of input materials have increased manyfold, which has forced them to increase the prices, he said. Since pumps made in places like Ahmedabad are cheaper, Soundararaj said their market share has reduced.

As many as 35 persons have submitted applications, most of them under benami names, for mining laterite in Natavaram mandal in an area of 30,680 acres.Interestingly, an auto driver was among the applicants. Jarta Lakshmana Rao applied for mining 10 lakh metric tonnes per annum for 14 years. The estimated cost of mining for this period is Rs 80 lakh.\"How can an auto driver invest such a huge amount,\" CPM district secretary Ch Narsinga Rao asked. The CPM leader said as per revenue records, the auto driver does not belong to the Girijan community.Though the mining area falls under Schedule V, the government has accepted applications from non-tribals, most of them belonging to East Godavari district where the Vantada laterite mining issue is also embroiled in controversies. Even as opposition to the project is growing among tribals, the government has decided to go ahead with public hearing which will be held at Erakannapalem on November 17.The authorities have also shown the area as unsurveyed hill area. More than 500 acres of land are cultivated through water drawn from three checkdams constructed by ITDA, while cashew plantation is taken up in another 400 acres. Sundarakota, Thorada, Munthamamidi and Bhamidika villages, located on the hillock, have thick vegetation where cashew nut, mango and other crops are cultivated.But the authorities mentioned in the environment impact assessment (EIA) report that the land was barren and hence, permission was given to undertake mining of the hillock for laterite. \"The villagers cultivate paddy, tobacco, cashew nut and other crops. How could the authorities allow some private contractor to mine the area?\" Samatha organization president Ravi Rebbapragada said.Forum for Better Visakha convenor E A S Sarma alleged that the EIA report furnished by the authorities was loaded with factual errors and false information. He demanded that the government initiate action against the erring officials for allowing the project to come up in violation of the tribal laws and norms. Laterite is used as an additive in the cement industry. The estimated industrial consumption of laterite in 2010-11 was approximately four million tonnes.Meanwhile, the CPM has demanded the government to stop the public hearing at Erakannapalem. It also said the public hearings at Poodi in Rambill for extracting calcium alluminate and at Thimmapuram in S Rayavaram mandal to dig ferro alloy should be cancelled.',\n",

In SEE-2010, only 10,000 students were enrolled out of 31,536 applications, which were received.

As far as enrolments are concerned, only 60,000 students took admission in various engineering courses against total 1,13,500 seats. As a result, nearly 54,000 seats remained vacant.Experts blame it on the excess number of seats for both engineering and MBA in the state. \"It seems that the admission process is stress free here. The quality of education in management colleges has gone for a toss. This is because in UP, we do not have a provision of group discussion and personal interview during the admissions,\" said Prof VK Singh, member, Central Admissions Board (CAB), which is responsible for conducting state entrance examination every year.With such a high number of seats, it is impossible to carry out GD/PI exercise for the colleges.Vice-chancellor Gautam Buddh Technical University Prof Kripa Shanker blames it on the mushrooming number of colleges with lack of faculty and infrastructure. \"The companies look out for quality students. In the absence of proper teaching, we have failed to produce good products. Also, the investment-return ratio is not upto the mark for students.\"Vice-chancellor, Mahamaya Technical University (MTU) (which will be conducting SEE this year) Prof S Kak said, \"There is a severe crunch of faculty that plagues the higher education sector.

But, also for the first time, the number of US students in India has jumped by over 44%.According to the Open Doors annual survey by the US\\' International Institute of Education (IIE), students from India decreased by 1% to a total of 104,000. \"Yet, India, as a destination for US students study abroad, increased 44.4%,\" said the survey. Despite the decline though, Indian students represent 14% of all international students in US higher education and the nation is by far the favourite destination for Indian students overseas.The spike in Chinese students in the US, the survey said, is largely responsible for the country registering a 5% growth in international students in its colleges and universities during the 2010-11 academic session. China has increased its student population in the US to about 158,000 by 23%, pushing it to the top of foreign sources of students in the US.Interestingly, India has jumped to 14th place as a destination for US students going overseas. At 3,884, US students in India have climbed by 44%, moving India up from the 21st spot the year before. China remains a greater favourite, with 13,910 US students in China, or a rise of 2% from last year. The beeline for India and China is explained by the global interest in these two rising nations.According to the study, the college campuses that reported increases in the international student intake also recorded more foreign government sponsorships. This applies for a large number of students from China, said others familiar with the flow of international students to the US. Indian students are overwhelmingly private citizens and depend on funding from scholarships and teaching assistantships. After the recession, many of these have dried up, and this may have had an effect on the student flow, they believe. The Open Doors survey said almost 70% of the funding for international students comes from outside sources.Usually, the number of international students at colleges and universities in the US increased by 5% to 723,277 during the 2010-11 academic session. It said, this was a record high number of international students in the country, the fifth straight year of student increases  fast emerging as a major service sector earner for the US. \"Higher education is among the United States\\' top service sector exports, as international students provide significant revenue not just to the host campuses but also to local economies of the host states for living expenses, including room and board, books and supplies, transportation, health insurance, and support for accompanying family members,\" the survey said.The top 10 most popular fields of study for international students in the US continue to be business and management (22%), engineering (19%), mathematics and computer science (9%), physical and life sciences (9%), social sciences (9%), fine & applied arts (5%), health professions (5%), intensive English language (5%), education (2%), humanities (2%) and agriculture (1%).',\n",

But it was not long before the deadly asbestos fibres spoiled her health greatly and she is now in a sorry plight.Ram Lal and Rachel Lee are now among the forerunners demanding a complete ban on asbestos to save the humanity from deadly diseases such as asbestosis and cancer.And it is people like them that brought like-minded organisations working for a complete ban on mining and use of asbestos products on Monday here under the banner of Global Ban Asbestos Movement for a two-day conference.The conference organised jointly by Asian Ban Asbestos Network (ABAN), International Ban Asbestos Secretariat (IBAS), Occupational and Environmental Health Network of India (OEHNI) and Mine Labour Protection Campaign (MLPC) was attended by over 70 people, including asbestos victims, doctors, lawyers, experts and other activists from more than 15 countries. They will also make a field visit to some of the stone manipulation factories around Jaipur on November 16.According to Laurie Kazan Allen of IBAS, \"Canada is continuing to export asbestos to many Asian countries, including India, even though it does not use this substance for its own industrial purpose. If India continues to use asbestos with heavy imports, a large number of exposures and infections would be reported in the near future and thousands of people would die. A large number of people had already been diagnosed with the deadly disease.\"India has the infamous distinction of being the world\\'s largest importer of asbestos. Annual asbestos consumption continues to grow in India and the country has used over seven million tonnes of asbestos so far. Perhaps on the brighter side, it is due to movements like this that India is considering the ban on the mining and use of Chrysotile asbestos to protect workers and the general population against primary and secondary exposure to Chrysotile form of asbestos.\"UK has used about six million tonnes of asbestos and as a result about 4,000 people die every year even now due to asbestosis. Imagine what plight would then face India, specially given the fact that healthcare facilities for workers are much better in UK when compared to India,\" Allen added.MLPC managing trustee Rana Sengupta pointed out that the Rajasthan government had officially banned asbestos mining in 1986, after which no new lease was issued. The last mines were closed down in 2005 and the diseases among the labourers who worked there are being detected now because these ailments have a latency period of 15 to 20 years. Despite the ban, about 80 mines are currently operational in Jhadole region and about 2,000 workers are still employed there, he added.The activists at the conference took exception to the rich countries continuing to make profit from the trade in deadly asbestos and demanded that all countries put a complete ban on its mining and import and to identify the victims as well their family members who might have contracted the disease through secondary infection.',\n",

The chief executives of the three oil marketing companies are to meet on Wednesday and announce the reduction that will make pump prices even lower than the level on November 3 when the price was raised by Rs 1.80 a litre.The ministry started tracking movements in prices of crude and products in international markets as well as the rupee\\'s exchange rate more closely after the November 3 price increase sparked a sharp public outcry and drew allegations of lack of transparency in the pricing mechanism.Hopes of a reduction had brightened on Friday when Brent North Sea crude for December delivery shed 61 cents to a tad over $113 a barrel and New York\\'s main contract, light sweet crude for the same delivery period, retreated 23 cents to $97.55. Simultaneously, the price of petrol in Singapore bulk market too dropped to $115 a barrel from an average of $125 last month.Petrol price in India is benchmarked to a combination of Brent and Dubai crude and petrol\\'s rates in the Singapore bulk market. The oil marketers follow a fortnightly pricing cycle and the fall in crude and product prices have brought down the average for the fortnight and also offset the impact of the rupee\\'s fall from 46 to about 49 to a dollar.When the oil companies jacked up petrol price on November 3, TOI had then first reported that the companies went for the price increase even when they had started making about 25 paise since October 28, implying they should have waited a bit longer in view of the emerging trend.

Goods trains aren\\'t safe either: rackets and petty thieves based in slums along the track steal coal, iron plates and other cargo transported through the railways.On Friday night, an incident of mobile thefts of two passengers delayed the Raipur-bound Shivnath express by around 15 minutes. Passengers pulled the alarm chain immediately after the incident which took place as the train pulled out of the platform. They also tried to chase the miscreants but they sped away towards Mominpura.Around a fortnight ago, a passenger travelling in Azad Hind Express even had suffered a fall from the running train after a miscreant tried to snatch his mobile phone. The injured passenger, however, did not give up the chase and was lucky to get the mobile phone back as the miscreant dropped it while escaping. A local rickshaw driver, resident of Mominpura, had helped the injured man reach the GRP before he was taken to a hospital.The rickshaw driver, talking to TOI on the condition of anonymity, said that such incidents of mobile snatching are becoming common due to the nexus of the miscreants and the railway security force personnel. \"There is no patrolling along the tracks where these miscreants lie in wait. Police know about these rackets but turn a blind eye for vested interests,\" he said. The driver said a section of the local residents, residing in Mominpura, Kasabpura, Dobi Nagar and Ansar Nagar are well aware of these miscreants but cannot resist for the fear of being harmed. \"These miscreants are equipped with arms,\" he said.Competition among coal thieves had led to at least two murders in the past couple of years. In a case that took place in 2009, a man was found killed near Godhni railway track. In another case, a man was found dead near Godhni village last year. In both the cases, sharing of booty from coal theft was the reason. Cases were registered at Koradi police station.The role of rackets involved in mobile thefts came to fore after recent murders in Mominpura. In one case in October, a man was killed by his rivals who were part of such a racket. The latest murder, in which the fire arms were used, was also perpetrated by the gang whose one of the many activities was learnt to be robbing railway passengers.Though theft from cargo is common, authorities of Western Coalfields Limited and Mahagenco, which uses the railways to transport coal, denied having information about it.MK Singh, general manager, public relations, WCL, said that railways should be able to furnish replies in connection to such cases of thefts.

Therefore it is expected that the Arya Samaj would ensure that the parties are major and legally competent for marriage, before issuing the marriage certificate,\" observed Justice Sudhir Kumar Saxena.The order came as the court came across that a marriage certificate was issued to minor girl and she denied any marriage with the alleged groom. \"There is no column in the certificate showing the date of birth of the parties to the marriage. As such, it is apparent that without insisting on proof of age, marriage certificates are being issued by Arya Samaj,\" said the judge adding that this is not conducive in the interest of the society.\"Insistence on proof of age would prevent issuance of marriage certificate to the minor parties,\" reasoned the judge.A habeas corpus petition was filed in the high court on behalf of Sanju Devi through her alleged husband Gulab Chand that she has been illegally detained by her parents. The court had issued notice to her parents. Sanju appeared in the court along with her mother. It was informed on her behalf that she was minor and she did not know Gulab Chand.

And now that prices are decreasing at a fast clip, the same speculators are rushing to offload their positions to cut losses, which in turn, is bringing down prices further.Since Sunday, when the US forces killed Osama bin Laden, the world\\'s most wanted terrorist in Pakistan, the dollar has strengthened against most major currencies. Since commodities have an inverse relationship with the dollar, the resultant adjustment has led to commodity prices falling. To add to this, Comex has hiked margin requirement for silver contracts by as much as 84% effective May 9.One of the leading bourses around the world for trading silver, Comex has said that Monday onwards, the minimum cash requirement for trading in a silver contract will be $21,600, up from $11,745. This means traders will have 84% less cash at their disposal, which in turn means less funds for speculating.While globally silver prices have fallen from a record high of $48.4 per ounce on April 28 to $35 now-a drop of 27%, it has slid from Rs 75,000 per kg to about Rs 54,000 now in the Mumbai market.

The children were invited by Airports Authority of India (AAI), Jaipur, aiming to enhance their knowledge about aircraft and functioning of airports.Officials said it was presumably first of its kind initiative by AAI, Jaipur, to bring underprivileged children inside the airport. For the children, it\\'s a fantasy trip to get closer to terminal buildings, apron, ATC, runway, fire station, MT Pool and conveyer facility.NGO\\'s like SOS Balgarm, Surman Sansthan and I-India joined hands with AAI for this initiative.As part of the Children\\'s Day celebrations at the airport, the children were offered cakes followed by singing and recitation by some students on the second floor of the terminal building. For some, it was a fun ride on the escalators and whiles others chose to climb-up and down. They were equating it with shopping malls but with lot of space, less people and little shops. Every moment brought them surprises and their dream to see the airplanes from barely few metres away came true.They were also lucky enough to visit the 70-metre tall Air Traffic Control (ATC) building, the most restricted area of the airport. The tower surrounded by glass walls gave a picturesque view of the city and the airport. Their excitement was high when the ATC officials informed of arrival of a flight.The children could not take their off the flight which took a round of the airport before it aligned itself with the runway for landing. To take a perfect view of the landing, the children climbed on sofas and tables at the ATC and hold their breath till the flight\\'s nose wheel touched the ground. They were also allowed to hear live conversations between the pilots and the ATC officials. It was a moment of joy for them as so far they had seen airplanes only up in the sky.Another event which the children enjoyed the most was the live demonstration of fire fighting vehicles imported from Austria. AAI has six such mammoth fully automatic vehicles with hydraulic ladder which can throw up water jets up to 70 metre. It can flush out 5,000 litre of water in one minute.During the demonstration, the vehicles fired water jets up to 70 metre high against the wind. When the pressure weakens, water droplets rain down on the children much to their delight. \"Lovely, this vehicle can create rain!,\" said Amar Surman, a student of Surman Sansthan. The AAI officials entertained every child of the group with the same enthusiasm and explained to them even the complex functions of the airport and aircraft in simpler ways.They only disappointment these children had was when they wanted to touch the airplane which was not allowed due to security reasons. However, when the airport director, R K Singh, was informed of their wish to fly, he assured them of conveying this request to the airlines to organize a joy ride for these children. \"I am hoping that in the coming months, I with the co-operation of airlines will able to organize such a trip,\" Singh said.People were amazed by the discipline of the 80 students as they entered and left the building in queues. Even CISF officials were very pleased by their regard for all rules with a smile.',\n",
       " '58f83fbd7be9e078c98bc6c3': 'MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India\\'s (RBI) decision on Tuesday to hike interest rate on savings bank account , among a host of other crucial decisions, is expected to dent the net interest margin of banks by 5-15 basis points (100 basis points=1%).This, along with a hike in key policy rates which will lead to loans being costlier and stricter provisioning norms, are expected to hit banks\\' bottomlines over the next few quarters. Little wonder that several banking stocks have been downgraded of late. And there are chances of some more downgrades.On Tuesday, RBI said that on all savings bank deposits banks will have to pay interest at 4% per annum, up from 3.5%. This is expected to hit those banks harder which have a higher portion of their deposits in savings bank accounts, compared to in current accounts (called CASA in banking parlance).\"The RBI move to increase interest rate offered on savings account deposits is expected to pull down the net interest margins of banks,\" said a report from Crisil Research, a division of the ratings major Crisil. With about 23% of the banking sector\\'s deposits coming from savings accounts, the impact because of the increase in interest rate could be about 10 basis points. \"The impact would be higher for banks with a higher proportion of savings accounts in their deposit mix,\" noted Ajay Srinivasan, head, Crisil Research.While savings accounts constitute 30-35% of the total deposits of banks like SBI, PNB, HDFC, the corresponding figure is 15-20% for banks like Corporation Bank and OBC. Analysts feel that along with higher interest outgo, other factors like moderation in credit growth and higher bad loans would combine to pull down profits of banks. In its post-policy report , Goldman Sachs lowered price target for most banks under its coverage. GS analysts lowered 12-month price target for banks by 0-9% and adjusted earnings till FY13 between 10% and 4%.For example, it cut SBI\\'s target price to Rs 2,700 from Rs 2,800, HDFC Bank\\'s to Rs 2,440 from Rs 2,470 and ICICI Bank\\'s to Rs 1,225 from 1,235.Analysts at other broking houses, like ICICI Securities, Religare Capital Markets, BRICS Securities, Anand Rathi Share & Stock Brokers and others, also feel that the interest rate hike and other decisions would hit banks\\' bottomline and have also warned investors.The series of rate hikes that the central bank has effected since March 2010, already had its impact on bank stocks. So far in 2011 alone, out of the 41 bank scrips, 37 have given negative return, with the highest being nearly 29% in Karnataka Bank. Sector analysts believe that since the RBI expects it would take another six months for the rate of inflation to start moderating, banking stocks would continue to give negative returns.',\n",

Presently the authorities are finding it difficult to get information about any employee as the records are not maintained properly.The MC has bought a special software which will also help in keeping a check over the movements of the employees. According to the officers there is such lack of transparency in the department that when they issue chargesheets to employees the papers disappear in between and despite several attempts the documents remain untraceable.Therefore, it has become essential for the department to maintain proper records of the employees. The online record would also help in maintaining a track of attendance so that employees do not remain absent from their duties.The proposal was recently approved by members of Finance and Contracts Committee (F&CC), to whom it was submitted. The members have allocated Rs 4 lakh for installation of software and hardware in the MC office for feeding the data.Sources said the civic authorities have consulted a private agency for the purpose. The company has already supplied the software to the corporation authorities and hardware has also been installed at D-zone office of the corporation. Sources said the authorities will begin uploading the data of employees in the server but it would take almost four months in fulfilling the entire procedure.When contacted additional commissioner KP Brar said after getting sanction from F&CC members they started feeding the data of employees working in corporation. ''This system will help in bringing transparency in the department,'' she said.Requesting anonymity, an MC official informed that employees take loan from corporation on the understanding that the amount is to be deducted from their salaries. ''However, since a proper record is not maintained the authorities find it difficult to recover the loan amount from employees which results in financial loss to the corporation,'' he said.Earlier, the corporation authorities had announced the installing of biometric attendance system in all the four zones of MC for regularizing the attendance of employees but nothing came of it.\",\n",

Many of them have shared their bitter experiences on blogs and various travel websites.Never-ending traffic jams, accidents are a regular on the NH-8. Akanksha Anand, a resident of Jaipur and a frequent commuter on the highway said, \"It is hard to believe that this highway is part of India\\'s premier tourist hub Jaipur-Agra-Delhi.\"According to National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), local traffic like mini buses, jeeps, jugads and animal carts that ply on the highway cause jams and accidents. \"Sometimes, passenger vehicles abruptly stop on the road to pick up passengers that results in a traffic jam,\" said Rakesh Gupta, a senior officer of NHAI.At several points, the barricades are broken and cyclists too, use the road, often travelling on the wrong side. \"It\\'s dangerous to see trucks, tractors, trolleys and other vehicles without rear lights, overtaking vehicles without giving the proper signals and completely disregarding the rules,\" said Piyush Sharma, another frequent commuter on the NH-8.Due to the broken roads, the cash-starved Rajasthan State Roadways Transport Corporation (RSRTC) is also coughing up more on the maintenance of their buses especially the Volvo service plying on this route. \"The bumpy ride along with prolonged hours means the buses give less mileage and demand early service,\" an official said.For the commuters, there\\'s no respite till June 2012, when the work on the six-lane road is expected to be completed.

The government\\'s notice to all interns to resume work within 24 hours, though, failed to deter them from their hunger strike.On Friday, the meeting between interns, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) and Mantralaya officials proved futile as both parties refused to soften their stand. The students insisted that the government has to give definite answers on the likely increase in stipend amount whereas the officials insisted that the students have to withdraw their strike before any further negotiation can take place.Meanwhile, around 300 students assembled outside Mantralaya hoping to get some positive news from the officials. But as soon as they got the negative feedback, they started shouting slogans. Soon after, the police reached the spot and picked up the students and detained them at Azad Maidan. The medical interns were under detention till late in the evening.Speaking to TOI, Dr Pravin Shingare, joint director of DMER, said that the government was upset with the students\\' attitude. \"Asking for a six-fold hike is impractical,\" he said. The interns are demanding that their stipend amount be raised from Rs 2,550 to Rs 13,000. Shingare added that the stipend was increased in 2009. \"Just two years ago, their stipend was increased from Rs 1,700 to Rs 2,550,\" he said. \"It is not feasible to give them a hike every two years, but we are still considering giving them a good amount,\" said Shingare.The DMER also specified that all interns have been served notices to resume duty within the next 24 hours.Members of the Association of State Medical Interns (ASMI), however, stood their ground. \"We are not calling off the strike until we get an affirmative assurance about the exact hike amount,\" said Dr Taufiq Panjawani, member, ASMI.

The field is in the eye of a storm created by ONGC\\'s demand for change in the royalty regime in return for giving up its pre-emption right and allow Vedanta Resources to take over Cairn India. ONGC is a 30% partner in the field.In a January 20 letter, Cairn accused ONGC of not offering timely support for effective functioning of the joint venture that operates the acreage. The acreage provides 90% of Cairn India\\'s valuation. Broadly, Cairn complained that ONGC was not cooperating in timely scheduling of management committee meetings or approving issues for effective functioning of the joint venture.On January 24, ONGC shot back to describe Cairn\\'s allegations as \"vain effort\" at passing the buck. The state-run company said by making the allegations against ONGC, Cairn was merely passing the onus of its responsibilites on to the committee. Management committees consist of representatives from the companies holding the development rights, the oil ministry and the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons, the ministry\\'s regulatory arm. An operator cannot recover investments from revenues unless the expenses are cleared by the committee.ONGC said DGH and the ministry have been pushing for quarterly meetings. As such, the onus is on Cairn to hold timely meetings as per needs of the quarter and coordinate with all concerned. On complaint of Cairn having trouble in scheduling one particular meeting to discuss critical issues, ONGC said the \"finalisation of the management committee meeting was held back by Cairn for reasons best known to it\".ONGC pointed out that some delays also took place because Cairn wanted to incorporate some remarks in the proceedings of a previous meeting after all other committee stakeholders had endorsed them. ONGC also accused Cairn of not sharing information on its proposal for optimising production. Such proposals, ONGC said, will need concurrence from the DGH and the ministry. While ONGC has been requesting the operator to furnish relevant confirmation on this issue, we are not aware of efforts made in this direction.',\n",

In the absence of arrangements made by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation for feeder buses on the Yamuna Bank-Noida line, thousands of passengers who use the 6-km stretch from Noida sector 15 to sector 32 daily, are forced to haggle with autorickshaw drivers who charge a lot considering the absence of alternative modes of travel.Residents say the problem is at its worst at the sector 32 City Centre station where the existing Metro line terminates. In the absence of feeder buses, residents have little choice but to opt for cycle rickshaws that are too slow or pay extra and take autos.While the authorities say they are aware of the problem faced by residents in the absence of feeder buses, they are yet to come up with a concrete solution. According to Lalji Choudhary, regional transport officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, when the Noida Metro line was started in 2009, the Uttar Pradesh government had pitched in with the UP State Road Transport Corporation and decided to run 78 feeder buses across the city. However, the plan never worked out due to financial constraints on part of UPSRTC. And while the Noida Authority and UPSRTC say they are working on a new intra city transport model for Noida, they add that the plan is in a nascent stage.\"Even if one has to travel to distant areas like sector 62, where all the offices are located, or till the NTPC building or the RTO office in sector 33, one has to get down at the city centre station as it is the last one. From there one cannot opt for cycle rickshaws as they are too slow and not suitable to go all the way to areas like sectors 62, 58, 63, etc, so one is forced to haggle with the auto-wallahs,\" said Ramesh K Bharati, who works at HCL in sector 62. \"The third and very unviable option is to wait for almost 20 minutes to catch an overcrowded bus,\" he said.\"We have formed a Special Purpose Vehicle with the Noida Authority and are mulling over introducing a new fleet of buses to connect all major pockets within the city. However, nothing concrete has been decided yet and the plan will take at least a couple of years to materialize,\" said Sandeep Raizada, assistant regional manager, UPSRTC. \"There is another proposal to start a fleet of feeder buses connecting all metro stations in Noida, but it is stuck due to division of kilometres between the DTC and DMRC,\" said Lalji Choudhary.As far as autos and their errant pricing is concerned, RTO officials claim that they are planning a crackdown on all such autos and will soon regulate the auto fares for all the 3,500 CNG autos plying within the city. \"We have stopped registering any new autos without a fare meter installed and we will soon have a meeting with the auto rickshaw union and the Authority to regulate the fares,\" said Lalji Choudhary. \"The problem is that the auto drivers are not agreeing to the proposed fare structure and are asking for as structure at par with that in Delhi. However, we hope to sort this out by next month,\" he added.\"There have been times when I have had to pay up to Rs 80 to the auto drivers just to go from the city centre station till my office in the NTPC building in sector 34 because I would get late by taking a cycle rickshaw,\" said Harjeet Singh, a resident of sector 14.',\n",

In its third year of implementation, RMSA looks to address issues connected with access, equity and quality in secondary education.The other major recommendations of the workshop are to evolve mechanisms for continuous in-service training and professional development, conduct research and monitoring specifically for quality inputs, effective monitoring of academic structures and integration of ICT in these areas.According to M P Vijayakumar, advisor, SSA, Tamil Nadu, who was among the participants, CCE implementation is being tested in state board schools at the primary level. \"We tried it in one block in Tiruvallur two years ago and are now doing a pilot test in Tiruvallur and Coimbatore. Its (large-scale) implementation has been recommended by the technical support group of RMSA to all states. This has to be examined by the Tamil Nadu government before it can be implemented. We will need to build capacities \"The NCERT should also develop a comprehensive baseline for the skills that children are expected to and ensure teachers are trained to handle this policy before we can go ahead,\" he said.With the document detailing the steps required for introducing quality intervention in secondary education, Vijayakumar said the state would have to develop a definitive timeframe to implement it.imbibe on completion of secondary education.

Local steel manufacturers say that the sector was anticipating the development and steel prices have already increased by 25% in a couple of months. This is enough to take care of the increase in prices.However, VIA president Pravin Tapadia said that the 163% hike in price of B-grade coal will put industries located in Central India at a disadvantage vis-A -vis those near to the ports as the price of imported B-grade coal is lower by Rs 1,200 per tonne. \"Now we will get coal at Rs 4,000 per tonne from CIL. But adding the transportation cost to cheaper imported coal the total price would be same as that of the CIL\\'s hence putting the local manufacturers at a disadvantage.Steel prices were cut by Rs 1,000 a tonne last week. Sources said that the cut back was on the basis of inputs to the steel lobby that excise duty may remain unchanged at 10%. The prices were kept up on expectations that the duty may be hiked to 12%. Steel traders are in a hurry to liquidate the stock as they might not get a reason to increase the prices.The recent hike in steel prices will provide enough cushion to the manufacturers, said Devendra Balasariya of Precision Wires. Steel trader Krisnha Rathi said even as B-grade coal is used in re-rolling industry the massive hike of 163% in its rates can be still offset by the current steel prices.However, Dipen Agrawal, secretary of NVCC said that the coal price hike will increase the input cost for steelmakers by around Rs 700 leading to a proportionate rise in the prices.',\n",

HBP is also developing the product to support a mobile browser. \"We\\'re planning to launch this mobile learning solution within June-August timeframe this year. As a population with high adoption rates of mobile devices, we anticipate this mobile learning solution to provide great value and update in India to both individuals and organizations,\" said Vivek Chachra, director corporate learning, HBP India.India\\'s premier institute, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIM-A), offered a few certificate programmes in e-learning in the past for working executives. But it did not meet with much success. International business schools are, however, keen on exploring e-learning tools for Indian managers.Wharton\\'s Executive Education Division (Aresty Institute of Executive Education) has identified e-learning, especially in the mobile space, as a key part of its delivery strategy. It has formed two separate centres of excellence that will focus on what it terms as connected learning (eLearning) and mobile enabled learning. Additionally, its efforts are closely coordinated with initiatives taking place at the school level around effective use of technology to enhance the learning experience.The institute would look at making such tools available in India as well. \"I believe that embracing the dissemination of knowledge and its value proposition via mobile is key to our strategy moving forward globally. This certainly includes a focus on professionals and organizations within India,\"\\' said Louis Metzger, senior director, IT, Aresty Institute of Executive Education, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.Wharton Executive Education has conducted a mobile device pilot leveraging Apple\\'s iPad. \"We feel that providing this type of device (including smart phones and other handheld devices) can enhance and extend the engagement taking place in the classroom,\" said Metzger.One of the major points highlighted by this pilot was that participants/students can provide real-time feedback to the faculty/presenters. The results of surveys and polls are available in real time. When data is available quickly, staff and subject matter experts can make adjustments and adapt content to participants needs as they arise.\"As Wharton Executive Education continues to expand its use of the iPad, more programmes, including our advanced management programme, will be added. The ultimate goal is to create an enhanced educational experience that includes richer course content,\\'\\' said Metzger.HBP\\'s research, has revealed that busy professionals are seeking trusted answers to key management and leadership problems, increasingly at the moment of need. \"Managers are overwhelmingly interested in a mobile resource that would provide a quick introduction or refresher on a specific management task (for example, how to manage a difficult conversation or test the validity of an ethical decision). In addition, corporate learning professionals are looking to take advantage of lost time in their learners day, like time spent commuting, by using a mobile device while on the go,\\'\\' said Chachra.Groundbreaking ideas and best management practices have been the basis of leader and manager development programmes for over a decade now. \"This mobile offering will take advantage of pervasive delivery platforms and offer just-in-time performance support that requires short engagement while delivering high utility,\\'\\' said Chachra.When learnings from HBP\\'s e-learning tool become visible in India later this year, other institutes can be expected to follow suit.',\n",

As a proportion to the total government expenditure, share of health, nutrition, water supply and sanitation stood at 5.48% on an average during 2005-2009. India spends less than 2% of GDP on health while out-of-pocket spending on health is 73%.With some of the world\\'s worst indices, India can ill-afford this indifference. Consider this: two million children under 5 years die every year in India, almost one out of three malnourished children live in India and 45.9% children under 3 years are underweight.Demanding an increase in the health budget, Save the Children CEO Thomas Chandy said children were dying of preventable and treatable causes. Reduction of high levels of child and maternal mortality would be difficult to achieve with the current rate of spending. Chandy said, \"The government must demonstrate the political will to stop this silent epidemic that is diminishing the country\\'s future.\"According to an analysis of public spending on health, nutrition, water and sanitation by Save the Children, expenditure had reached 1.58% in 2008-09 despite successive governments\\' claims to increase the health spending to 2%- 3% of GDP. But health expenditure alone without expenditure on water supply and sanitation and nutrition was less than 1% of GDP in 2004-05. This has only gone up marginally to 1.09% of GDP in 2008-09, according to the health ministry.Spending on health care in India remains low in comparison to many developing and developed countries. Most European countries spend about 9%-11% of their GDP on public health. Government expenditure as a share of the total health expenditure in India is less than what Asian countries such as China and Indonesia spend on health care.This has a direct impact on maternal and child mortality. Globally, it is estimated that an annual rate of decline of 4.4% is needed to reduce deaths of children under 5 by two-thirds by 2015. In India, the annual rate of decline in child mortality between 1990 and 2008 is 2.25%.

However, from there, owing to the flood, all flights to and from Mumbai were cancelled and diverted to various other destinations.According to the complaint lodged by the Mehtas, the airline, instead of helping the stranded fliers, including themselves, provided no hotel accommodation or food. After protests, they were given some fruits and vegetables. But the airline did not give any facilities to the fliers as prescribed under the Civil Aviation Rules & Regulations, the Mehtas claimed.Around 4.30 pm on July 28, when the Mehtas were asked to have their bags screened and deposit them at the airline counter, they could locate only three pieces of luggage, instead for four. On top of that, the three bags had been opened and expensive articles stolen, the couple alleged. Their harassment apparently did not end there: At the time of boarding, Shenaaz was reportedly told that the flight was \"full and there was no seat available on the aircraft\". She was asked to take the next flight. However, after vehement protests, the Mehtas were put on the same plane.

It would need Singh\\'s intervention to ensure the mutually opposed arguments are resolved in a manner that meets green concerns but allows tapping of India\\'s considerable coal reserves.Sources said that the case for selective use of forest areas had been badly marred by non-implementation of afforestation norms. The task of reforesting an area after exploitation was often neglected and after several patches of a green area had been mined, the entire zone looked wasted and barren.What was needed, it is felt, is strict monitoring of afforestation as leases are worked patch by patch in green zones. Though this would not always be perfect, it would allow careful exploitation of coal reserves. With the mining industry boasting of a poor record, the environment ministry\\'s views had gained traction with the Congress leadership.

We will now take advantage of the situation and float fresh tenders for Danaganj, Jaripatka, Pachpaoli and Sitabuldi Water Works office malls,\" he said.Cotton Market full of filthThe Mahatma Phule Market, commonly known as Cotton Market, is becoming worse than a garbage dump, with slush, cow dung and rotting vegetable waste posing major problems for vegetable vendors and consumers. However, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation, which is responsible for maintaining cleanliness in the city and market areas, has blamed Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), which controls the particular market area for the problems being faced by citizens. NMC standing committee chief Sandeep Joshi said that the only solution to the problem is to give the entire market a facelift.The plan calls for giving Phule Market building and vegetable market outside an ultra-modern look and raise it to international standards. \"The project will require investment of Rs 90 crore and we have to shift the vegetable market elsewhere till the new building comes up,\" he said.Renowned architect Hafeez Contractor has already submitted a design for the redevelopment of the building. However, the project is still pending at the state government level with the then chief minister Ashok Chavan, who, on the request of vegetable vendors of Cotton Market, gave a stay on the project. \"Only after state government approval will we be able to give go ahead for the market to be redeveloped on Built-Operate-Transfer (BOT) basis,\" Joshi said.Free run for hawkersDespite Nagpur Municipal Corporation\\'s decision to free prime locations in Sitabuldi, Sadar and Dharampeth markets from encroachment of vendors and hawkers by appointing a private contractor, illegal hawkers have a free run. They brazenly operate from \\'no-hawking\\' zones earmarked by the civic body. NMC had earmarked 27 such zones, which include Kachipura, Ramdaspeth, Lokmat Square, Panchsheel Square, Rani Jhansi Chowk, Variety Square, Bajaj Nagar, Shankar Nagar, Laxmi Bhavan to Law College Square, Jaistambh Square, Shri Mohini Complex, LIC Square, Mount Road, Ashoka Hotel, Canara Bank to Achraj Tower Square.Unauthorised markets thriveWith a view to regularise unauthorised weekly vegetable markets mushrooming in various parts of the city, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation had planned to give them alternative land. However, nothing concrete was done in this regard yet. NMC decided to give priority to hawkers holding NMC registrations and conducting business themselves in such markets. Facilities like vendor platforms, power supply, public lavatories, benches and parking space at these markets were also planned, but all this remained on paper and the projects failed to take off. At present over 50 unauthorised weekly markets operate in places like Jaitala Road, Rameshwari Road, Wardha Road, Sakkardara Road, Khamla Road, Sonegaon, Sadar and cause inconvenience to motorists, commuters and nearby residents.',\n",

For the third year in a row, there were no fatal New Year\\'s eve accidents.Policemen of all ranks -- the commissioner himself, joint CPs, DCPs, ACPs and inspectors -- were out in strength patrolling the streets. The result: 484 people were challanned, of them 388 for drunk driving. As many as 4,500 traffic policemen and 22,000 policemen kept vigil.As 500 traffic policemen scoured the city on motorcycles, many were hauled up for rash driving. At least 100 teams broken into 6-12 man groups nabbed drivers who had drunk beyond permissible limits.As cops started crackdown on drunk and unruly drivers on night of December 31, policemen patrolling north and south Delhi - especially areas close to farmhouses - were the busiest. As many as 88 cars were impounded in the city after their drivers were found drunk.\"The possibility of driving licences being suspended and fears of a jail term deterred people from driving drunk. We posted our men strategically, especially along routes people usually take while driving back from parties. This worked. Fewer drunk drivers were on the roads. The night was accident-free,\" joint commissioner of police (traffic) Satyendra Garg said.Drunk driving is a non-compoundable offence -- which means that those caught in the act can\\'t get away paying fines. They must face the court. Drunken driving is punishable under section 185 of the Motor Vehicles Act. Violators can be fined Rs 2,000 or sentenced to six months in jail or both. Repeat offenders can be fined Rs 3,000 and/or jailed up to two years. Since August, 700 of the 2,500 people challanned for drunk driving have been convicted and still more are likely to be given jail terms ranging from one day to two years.Traffic policemen used barricades put up by local police to flag down cars and check them. Most of those challanned for drunk driving claimed they had thought they were within limits and were not \"aware\" that they were breaking rules.Wary of tough police action, many Delhiites preferred to book cabs and hire drivers for New Year parties.Rashmeet, an advertising professional, said: \"It\\'s expensive to hire a driver but we were 15 people in four cars. All of us were planning to drink. Instead of ruining our night arguing with cops, we hired drivers for the night. This way, we partied hard and reached home safe.\"Others said they were forewarned by others. \"My friend left our party and was intercepted by policemen who slapped a drunk driving challan on him. I chose to play safe, went home in a cab. I went back to my friend\\'s place on Saturday morning and picked up my car,\" Ranjan, a call centre executive, said.But the city\\'s relatively accident-free run on Friday night took a hit when a group of four drunk men rammed their car into a constable in front of Laxmi Nagar\\'s V3S Mall around 10pm. The group in a WagonR car stopped at a police check post and began arguing with policemen that the barricades were constricting the carriageway. The exchange turned ugly and they banged into one of the constables, who suffered a fractured hand.\"Three of this group have been arrested,\" DCP (east) IB Rani said. \"Two of the four got out of the car and got into a heated argument with our men. Abruptly, they jumped back into the car. The driver, identified as Chandan, revved up the engine, rammed into constable Naval Kishore and tried to speed off. Our men caught them. Three of them -- Tarun, Sandeep and Chandan - were caught, but the fourth one, Jasbeer, escaped,\" Rani said.',\n",

Over 112 challans have been issued under the Motor Vehicles Act on Wednesday and Thursday to buses and trucks on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway for breaking lane driving norms.These vehicles often disrupt traffic in the city. On several occasions, we have warned the offenders to stick to their lanes and avoid causing inconvenience to other commuters on the busy Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway. We are carrying out this drive not only to ensure that drivers understand the importance of lane driving, but also to prevent untoward incidents, said Gurgaon DCP (traffic) Bharti Arora.The DCP added that heavy vehicles were supposed to stick to the second lane from the left and allow the third and fourth lanes (fast lanes) for other vehicles on the national highway.The district traffic police have also written to automobile giant Maruti Suzuki India Ltd (MSIL) to ensure that their trailer size is restricted to 12 meters or less in length. Also, the traffic police have increased the no-entry timings of these Maruti trailers from 7 am to 12 pm instead of 11 am in the morning and 4 pm to 10 pm instead of the earlier 8 pm. The RTA has issued 25 challans in the past 48 hours to oversized trailers , added the DCP (traffic).These oversized trucks and trailers were a major cause of massive traffic snarls for residents in adjoining areas like Sectors 17, 18, 21, 22, 23, 23 A and Palam Vihar. The oversized trucks should be stopped at the MSIL gate since they are not allowed to go up to Kapeshera border on the Old Delhi Road. However, the trailers come all the way up to Jwala Mills and then take a U-turn. Due to their dimensions, they are unable to maneuver the bend and end up breaking the railings, which poses a threat to other vehicles, said Harcharanjeet Singh, a retired civil servant living in Sector 23 A.Added Bhawani Shankar Tripathi, a resident in the same sector: The trucks are parked on land let out to transporters who can use it as parking space. Earlier, the trucks used to exit directly from outside the MSIL gate. However, since the road is dug up for over six months now, the trucks use the dividing Sector 22/23 road for exit. This has severely damaged the road. Asked if her department planned to write to HUDA, Arora said: I am not aware of the state of the road, but if need be, we will definitely write to the department concerned.The other point of concern is the unchecked parking of vehicles on the main road outside the MSIL factory.Traffic movement begins around 7 am. Trucks already on the road and unable to enter the Maruti premises park by the roadside leading to traffic snarls, asserted a Sector 23 resident.',\n",

       " '58f841667be9e078c98bc822': 'HYDERABAD: Since the beginning of December last, 220 tenant farmers in the state have committed suicide or died of shock, crushed by mounting debts and loss of crops. Overall, the farmer death toll stands at a staggering 350-400. Though the fickle weather wreaked havoc, experts believe it\\'s only partly to blame as several other factors have worked against the farming community.While economic expansion continues to bypass the farming community leaving them impoverished and in debt trap, subsidy cuts have made seed, fertilizer, pesticide and electricity more costly. \"This desperation is shocking. It puts spotlight on the hardship and growing disparities among the farmers. The ryots feel squeezed as never before,\" V Vinod Goud, agriculture scientist, Icrisat, observed.New snazzy cars zoom by and cellphones ring loud in the cities and towns, but in the countryside where the farmers toil they hardly get bank loans. \"Banks charge 7% interest for cars but take 12% and more on farm tractors. Little wonder 5% of ryot community in the last 3-4 years have shifted to other jobs,\" rued B Chandra Reddy, vice-president, AP Rythu Sangham (APRS).Though banks were supposed to lend term loans of Rs 54,050 crore to farmers, their target was slashed to Rs 15,652 crore. Curiously, banks do not lend to tenant farmers, while marginal farmers get a pittance. This dichotomy is seen more starkly in AP, which is known as the rice bowl of the country. In East Godavari district where at least 60 suicides were reported in the past two months, a vast majority of the ryots own less than five acres of land.While 75 per cent of the farmers\\' earnings go into the hands of traders and middlemen, everything else they earn goes to moneylenders and pesticide dealers. \"Our farmers get 1.67% subsidy whereas Pakistan offers 28% and China 39% to its farmers,\" Chandra Reddy revealed. He denied that failed crop alone sparked the suicide. He said unless state-owned banks raise lending to small farmers and extend loans to tenant farmers, the suicides won\\'t stop.Experts said the government education programmes have failed, leaving the mostly illiterate farmers dependent on private moneylenders and unscrupulous pesticide dealers for advice on managing crops. Most importantly, the deaths reveal the collapse of the rural banking system. Short of cheap bank credit, farmers were forced to turn to moneylenders who charge 30-35 per cent interest.Take the case of Regala Subbaiah, 27, a tenant farmer of Takkellapadu in Dachepalli mandal in Guntur. With little understanding of the risks involved, he blindly copied a neighbour who was earning handsomely from the white gold (cotton). He took five acres on lease and cultivated cotton in two acres, chilli in two and paddy in one acre by incurring a debt of Rs 1 lakh. He paid Rs 50,000 towards lease. But the dream quickly soured as the entire crop was destroyed in the rain.As his crops withered, Subbaiah\\'s creditors came calling. In addition to pesticide dealers, some were fellow farmers who lent surplus cash at high interest. In all, he owed about Rs 1.5 lakh, with little prospect of earning anything this season. With no hope, he committed suicide by hanging himself on Dec. 24.The farmers took a huge gamble on cash rich crops following an excellent monsoon. Over the past five years, many have switched from growing food staples such as rice, lentils and peanuts to cotton, chilli, tobacco because of the fabulous profits with greater investments on fertilizers and pesticides. In the past year alone, the area under cotton cultivation had swelled by 50 per cent in Warangal district.Pesticide dealers swarm the villages, promising farmers miracle results and credit. \"It\\'s a vicious circle. If they abandon commercial crops, they are certain to have low returns and the only alternative will be to sell their land,\" a professor of Centre for Economic and Social Studies said. Chalapati Rao, agriculture official, said pesticide dealers thrived on farmers\\' ignorance and encouraged them to go in for cash crops.The vacant look on the face of Lavuri Bala, a marginal farmer of Bolligutta thanda in Damarcharla mandal in Nalgonda, said it all. He tried to commit suicide on Dec. 14 by consuming pesticide, but his family rushed him to the hospital in time. After 10 days of treatment, he\\'s back. He incurred Rs 70,000 for pumpset and another Rs 10,000 loan to cultivate paddy in one acre. Bala, 38, already owed Rs 25,000 bank loan before the suicide attempt. His wife Padma ended her life last year over financial woes.As the demands for moratorium on loans, lowering of interest rates and ensuring minimum support price increase, farmers\\' sangham leaders claim the government package was a sham. \"Even the paddy purchase centres are not willing to buy the wet stocks,\" said Jalagam Kumara Swamy of Bharatiya Kisan Sabha.Then what\\'s the way-out for the distressed farmer? \"The suicides highlight that the state needs to modernize agriculture on a priority. Educating ryots, supervision of technology, finance, investment and providing equitable markets hold key to their future,\" Vinod Goud opined.',\n",

After doing average business through most part of the year, their sales jumped by a good 30-40 per cent over the last two days of December 2010 (as compared to last year), thus accelerating their profits. Be it the small cars such as Ford Figo and Honda Jazz or the more popular sedans like Ford Fiesta and Honda Civic, all did good business during the year-end, say dealers.So what drove the sales on to the fast track? Hefty discounts by automobile manufacturers and speculations about a rise in price of cars in 2011. \"Also, a lot of customers prefer to buy it on December 31 or even January 1 as they feel it as a good time,\" said an industry insider pointing out how dealers usually do well on these days every year. \"However, many seem to have outdone their own previous performances this time,\" the source added.Take for instance Pride Honda. On the last two days of 2010 alone (December 30 and 31) the Honda car dealer sold close to 30 cars to buyers from the city. While the brand has always been on Hyderabad\\'s hot-list, it has never managed to cross the 10-15 mark during its year-end sales. Said Rakesh Kumar, chief executive officer of Honda Pride, \"This has been one of our best shows. Though we always see sales jump during the last week of December, it\\'s never so good.\" Kumar admitted that this sudden rise was primarily because of the many lucrative deals that were made available to its customers this time around. \"We offered discounts to the tune of Rs 20,000 on some cars, which is not heard of usually. Also, there were special exchange offers for existing Honda users,\" he said.Similar offers by dealers of Ford and Maruti in the city saw large crowds throng the stables of these brands too. If the Begumpet branch of Varun Motors (Maruti dealers) delivered as many as 12 cars on December 31 alone, more than 50 customers drove out of the Fortune Ford (Somajiguda) showroom over the year-end. \"It was the discounts that pulled the crowds,\" said Bashir Babukhan of Fortune Ford listing out the manufacturer\\'s special offers. \"Customers buying the Fiesta were given a cut ranging from Rs 20,000 to Rs 50,000. In some cases it even went up to Rs 60,000.\" The base price of this sedan is around Rs 7.5 lakh.The offers apart, these dealers say that speculations about a 10-15 per cent rise in price of automobiles (especially the high-end cars), in the next few months, drove many to seal their deals in 2010.Meanwhile, the year-end remained dull for some showroom owners who had even earlier in the year failed to do enough business. Mallik Cars for example witnessed a drop of over 50 per cent in their December sales. \"We earlier used to seal over 400 deals in this month with most signed on the last two days. This time, however, we have only managed to touch 225,\" said Rashmin Patel, general manager of Mallik cars. The Tata dealer that sold about 55 Indicas and Indigos on the last two days of 2010 hoped that the New Year would bring some luck.',\n",

Refusing to be drawn into the controversy, Rawat said, \"It indeed reflects poor on UP administration, where agriculture is the mainstay of the vast majority of people.\"Though attended by a galaxy of scientists drawn from all over the country, the function was a poor draw from UP functionaries, as none except horticulture secretary, Manoj Kumar Singh and GB Patnayak, principal secretary to the governor attended the function.On the occasion, nearly 60 farmers also took part in an interactive session with scientists. The strong contingent of farmers from UP was led by president of Kisan Jagriti Manch, Sudhir Panwar, who said this initiative would go a long way to improve the farming techniques and crop management pattern in the state.As for the absence of UP ministers and other functionaries, organisers of the Congress said that invites were extended to Siddiqui as well as other top officials of the agriculture sector. But they took the excuse for their unavailability on account of ongoing session of the UP Assembly. However, this turned out to be only a lame excuse, as there was no session of the House on Thursday and this was decided well in advance.The concern of the scientists over the issue of food security was shared by the governor in his inaugural address in which he underlined the role of planners and state functionaries for disseminating the benefits of lab to land. Scientists, alone could not solve the problem of food security, unless the executives and government functionaries work in coordination, he said.The importance of this conference, he said was of paramount for UP, a major part of which falls in the Indo-gangetic plains, which feeds the most part of the country.Speaking on the occasion, Rawat said that the cause of concern was that of falling fertility. This was evident from the fact that share of agriculture and its allied activities in GDP had come down from 57.7 per cent in 1950-51 to 25 per cent 1999-2000 and further dropped to 15.7 per cent in 2008-09. However, he said that despite the odd faced by the agriculture sector, its over-emphasising role in term of employment and food security could not be underestimated, particularly in the context of the country\\'s rural-based economy.He also complimented the National Academy of Agriculture Sciences for organising this event with a focus on soil, plant and animal health. He exhorted the scientists to transfer the technological gaps through research and extension facilities.He said that the government planned to increase the agriculture growth rate to 4 per cent with a greater emphasis on the cultivation of pulses and oil seeds. On the occasion, he also held a separate meeting with different functionaries of central research institutes here and asked them to develop new variates of fruits, particularly guava and mango that could be produced round the year in UP.',\n",

Their technical expertise has made cracking these cases difficult. \"Most importantly, these rackets are not only limited to one city but across the country, even abroad,\" Alok Kumar said.However, in early 2007, police invoked the anti-goonda act to nab the bettors. But this senior cop said it was not always easy to nab bookies as the act required a person to be continually involved in a crime for him to be arrested.Punishment too is not deterrent. \"The maximum punishment for betting is three months. He will either come out on bail or finish his term and get back to betting,\" Alok Kumar added.Asked if the money from betting was being channelised for other activities, he said there have been reports of this money being moved through hawala.

In the meantime, the DoE has already decided to assimilate class V in the primary section as required by the new act and this decision is likely to be brought into force from the new academic year. While in Goa, classes I to IV are considered to be primary level, the RTE classifies standard I to V as primary level, classes VI to VII as upper primary level, standards IX and X as secondary level and classes XI and XII as higher secondary level.Gearing up for the implementation of the RTE Act, the DoE has also begun the process of appointing 331 additional teachers in government primary schools to resolve the problem of single teacher schools in Goa at the primary level. During a meeting of states called by the ministry of human resource development (HRD) recently to discuss the implementation of the RTE Act, Goa had, along with a few other states, requested that they be allowed to appoint two-to-three more teachers in single teacher schools to aid the implementation of the provisions of the RTE Act.As per a survey conducted by the HRD ministry, Goa has one of the highest percentages of single teacher schools in the country at 34.75% as against the national average of 13.73%. Of the 927 government primary schools in the state, 273 schools are single teacher schools.As required by the RTE, the DoE has also prepared a plan to train in-service teachers in a phased manner over the next five years to upgrade their skills as required by the act.',\n",

The committee termed it as an \"autocratic act\" of the state government to cane charge lawyers, who, the association claimed were carrying out a peaceful march in support of their demand for budgetary allocation for lawyers welfare.It was on Friday that the lawyers clashed with the police after they were stopped near Parivartan Chowk.

When CBRI entered the scene, the quality of the work (pile/foundation work) executed by the developer upto May 2008 in this sensitive area of river bank could not be assured. It is observed that nothing was found in the records produced to audit which assured that the quality work was checked by any other agency or the DDA quality assurance team, reads the letter.In another report - of which TOI has a copy, - CBRI says: Seeing the permeability of the concrete and the corrosion of the reinforcing steel gives an impression that the service life of these towers cannot be more than 20 years. These towers demand a lot more expendure for the repair and retrofitting beyond this period.The audit memo points out that the reinforcing steel was never covered adequately despite three reports pointing to that deficit. It is more prone to corrosion when exposed to moisture, oxygen, acidic environments and chlorides. In many places, there was chipping of the cover concrete. The faulty beam-column joints were warned about in six of the 13 reports yet nothing was done about them, the memo alleges, asking for an explanation.Sources say the gap in some joints is so huge that there are bird nests there.Asked for his response to observations in the memo, DDA director (PR) Nemo Dhar said an audit memo merits reply to the auditor and not to the media. DDA sources, however, concede that the matter had indeed been raised time and again but not much done about it. The state of the buildings now is such that retrofitting them is the only option. That is going to cost another half to one-third of the money already spent on these flats, said a senior DDA official.It was observed that CBRI pointed out (report number 3) that many columns in the basement floors of towers 3,4,5 were out of plumb and some of them are tapered (the width reduced from 300 to 230 mm). This situation may pose a serious problem in the event of a severe earthquake as the construction site is located in seismic zone IV, that too on alluvial soil. The matter has been reported by CBRI to EmaarMGF, ACIL and DDA. It was also requested to ensure that no cosmetic treatment (plastering) was to be made as it would be difficult to identify these columns at a later stage, when the decision was taken to repair and retrofit these columns. Nevertheless, these columns had been plastered to cover up the deficiencies, the CAG letter reads.The memo also talks about how the reinforcement of beams and columns was improperly done even though the matter figured prominently in the first three CBRI reports. In their tenth report, CBRI is quoted in the memo as saying: Though we are insisting for the cover blocks and the bending of hooks for the last one and half years, the same is being neglected very deliberately.',\n",

We will soon know.The Union health ministry on February 7 informed the Supreme Court that a definitive study is now being undertaken by the National Institute of Nutrition (Hyderabad) \"to assess the effects of consumption of carbonated water beverages and soft drinks on health of adolescents and young adults\". The final report of the study is expected to come by February 2012.A letter written by ICMR scientist Dr G S Toteja said the study being conducted by NIN involved the screening of 2,000 adolescents and young adults (aged 18-35 years) each for identification of subjects with high and low carbonated beverage consumption levels.\"These subjects will then be followed to assess harmful effects of carbonated beverages,\" the letter to under secretary in the ministry Mohammad Saleem said.Speaking to TOI, NIN director Dr B Sesikeran said screening has already been completed. About 200 young adults who consume 600 to 4,200 ml/week have been recruited. An equal number of people who don\\'t consume soft drinks at all have also been selected by matching age and gender. The diet and nutrient intake of the 400 subjects has already been documented.The letter says, \"They will be followed up to nine months and the investigations such as biochemical parameters relating to bone, liver and kidney function tests, lifestyle patterns and dietary intakes will be assessed at baseline after four months and the end of 8-9 months. Changes if any will be observed.\" The consumption pattern of carbonated beverages will also be assessed. An adolescent group study will also be carried out on similar lines.According to Dr Toteja, available literature does not clearly establish a direct cause and harmful effect relationship between consumption of carbonated beverages and its effects on human health.Dr Sesikeran told TOI that NIN had earlier done a study on assessment of prevalence and determinants of overweight and obesity among urban adolescents in three regions of Andhra Pradesh. It clearly showed that cases of being overweight was more in the group that consumed carbonated drinks. However, the study was not pointed towards finding the effect of such drinks on health.He added, \"The latest study will establish the cause and effect relationship. The study will have 400 people who consume high amounts of carbonated drinks and 400 who don\\'t.\"Dr A Laxmaiah, deputy director at NIN who conducted the earlier study, said, \"The study was carried out in 7,905 (52% girls) people, aged 12-17 years in the three regions of Andhra Pradesh. Anthropometric measurements like height and weight, arm, waist and hip circumference and skin fold thickness were taken. The average duration of watching TV was higher in overweight and obese adolescents (1.4hrs/day) compared to normals (1.2hrs/day). The consumption of fast foods was significantly higher among the overweight adolescents compared to the normal children.\"Several studies have claimed that colas are bad for health.

The ministry has vested the power to determine the price for the much-sought-after carry bag with the municipal authorities.In another development, the ministry has also extended the ban on plastic below 40 microns across the country, much to the delight of environmental activists and others, who were irked by the clutter of plastic floating around. \"Whatever new rules MoEF has notified will apply if the Goa Non-Biodegradable Garbage (Control) Act, 1996, does not have them,\" science, technology and environment (STE) department director Michael D\\'Souza said.Greens are happy that confusion about the manufacture of lower density plastic will be dispersed by the new rules. \"This was a long-awaited notification as confusion prevailed over the manufacture of plastic below 40 microns,\" state coordinator of Chaka Chak Goa (CCG) Patricia Pinto said. Though the use of material below 40 microns was banned, its manufacture was allowed under the pretext that it was for dispatch to neighbouring states with a restriction of up to 20 microns. \"But the plastic material of the same density (20 microns or even less) would find its way back in Goa,\" Pinto added.The STE director conceded that an administrative order permitted the manufacture of plastic carry bags above 20 microns. \"Now, this order has no value with the notification of an uniform ban on material below 40 microns,\" he said. Now, the packaging of gutka, food items and liquor in plastic pouches and sachets is also banned.Environmental activists are hopeful the new rules will help reduce the quantum of litter. \"All our highways and streets are cluttered with the inferior quality material as nobody (recyclers) wants it and it has nowhere to go,\" North Goa coordinator of CCG Valerie Madredeus said.Dona Paula resident Camila Lobo agreed, \"The new rules will help reduce litter, but people need to cooperate with the authorities,\" she said.However, the changed conditions for the manufacturer will not impact local units, says Keshav Kamat of the Goa small industries association\\'s advisory committee. \"Our local units produce plastic above 40 microns.

The infant, born 93 days before time, was immediately brought to the NICU of Umrao hospital. Dr Pradeep Jain, paediatrician, said, \"The infant\\'s weight has increased to 1.2 kg. He is out of the ICU and kept in a home-like atmosphere in the hospital ward where we are watching his behaviour, feeds and motions.\" This is the first preterm baby weighing under 800 gram to survive in the Mira-Bhayander region.An elated Das says that she was depressed after the preterm birth of her son as she had lost her brother, who was born premature but could not survive. \"My baby has started responding to my voice. I am now waiting to take him home,\" said the first-time mom.Doctors at the hospital were taking each day with a new challenge. Doctors ensured that Sneha, who got the glimpse of her child only three days after he was born, was constantly with the infant. \"Premature babies lack the fat necessary to maintain their body\\'s temperature.

According to MARD, the amount for undergraduate students is expected to shoot up to around Rs 15 lakh from the existing Rs 5 lakh, and to around Rs 50 lakhs from Rs 15 lakhs for post-graduate students.The DMER has said there this nothing the department can do to salvage the situation as the proposal has been passed by the Cabinet.Joint director of DMER, Dr Pravin Shingare, has said the government plans to initiate an inquiry on the department for not hiking the fees in 2007. \"We are supposed to review the fees ever three years but thinking of students we had not done that,\" he said.Shingare explained that students studying in the state-run engineering colleges are also playing a fee of Rs 40,000. \"We cannot differentiate between students by charging medical students less,\" he said.',\n",

But, a number of Muslim women and girls-- particularly hailing from poor families-- are coming out to dispel the darkness of ignorance and bring about a new dawn for the coming generation of the community. They are doing the community proud by making sincere efforts at spreading literacy, especially among other girls and children.\"I started a madarsa under a tree with the help of the community in 2002. Then, there were only a handful of children studying in it. But, today, 150 students --100 girls and 50 boys-- are studying here,\" Razia Begum, the in-charge of Madarsa Gausia near Bari Masjid, Lohta, told TOI. Unlike most of the madarsas where mostly religious education is imparted, this madarsa imparts general education to bring the children of the Muslim community into the mainstream education. \"We began this work to bring our children into the mainstream of the society,\" said Razia, a high school passout. \"Besides formal education up to fifth class, the madarsa also runs vocational training centre for girls and women. The young women and girls above 15 are taught sewing at the centre,\" she said and added all the activities were run with the help of the community and a non-governmental organisation, Human Welfare Association (HWA).Razia is not alone in writing a new future for the community.

Parents of even eight or nine year olds want their kids to top in studies, in sports and cultural activities. The child is has live with almost impossible expectations.\"As the students progress, the stress factor keeps on increasing due to peer pressure, parental pressure and the system itself. Psychiatrists say that a 15-year-old is not mentally ready to handle such pressure. Ironically this at a time when schools are active in helping students cope with pressures. Many well-known CBSE-affiliated schools have full time counsellors to help students. CBSE also has a helpline where students and parents can call in.Mangala Patel\\'s son is in Class IX at SFS high school. Her son scores regularly in the 80s but she believes it is not good enough for him and so coaxes him to do better. So do other parents with their wards. Archana Deshpande, psychiatrist and full time counsellor at Modern School says, \"On an average four to five students come to me with their problems.\"Neeru Kapai, principal, Modern School, however thinks nowadays pressure has gone. Kapai under present pattern in CBSE, there is no pressure at all until Standard X. \"We have to promote students up to Class VII, the board exams for tenth too have been made optional. So where is the pressure,\" asks Kapai, a psychologist herself. She adds that pressure on students nowadays is not only because of studies but could be due to inter-student relations or home environment. Kana Roy Chowdhury, principal, Centre Point School, also feels the new CBSE pattern has relieved stress on students.S A Khandagle, principal, Seventh-Day Adventist school says their students are made to prepare for Class X from a year before. \"While they are in Class IX, we start teaching them subjects of Class X. So by the time they appear for the board they do not have much pressure.\" Khandagle does not agree that pressure is all bad.His view is echoed by Sister Arpita, principal, SFS high school. \"I am against cancelling of board exams. Some pressure is good. It helps students prepare for bigger tests in life,\" she said. There are parents who feel with cancellations of board exams, students will not take studies seriously. In a recent parent-teachers meeting at a well known CBSE school, a parent remarked that under new pattern, schools will not produce C V Ramans any more. The lady principal of the school replied, \"If not C V Ramans, we may have Sanjeev Kapoors (celebrity chef)\".All principals agreed that too much dilution is not too good. Manjusha Stephenson, principal, Bishop Cotton high school, says \"It is not good if a student knows he just can\\'t fail up to Class VIII.\" In her school alone, about 20 per cent students are pushed through each year.Chaudhari opines peer and parental pressure were weighing down students. \"Family members should play a more active role in helping ease stress. Spending quality time with your kids is very important,\" he adds.Sister Arpita says, \"value education comes from home. Many students now come from broken or disturbed homes. When parents are too busy in their professional life, the students miss out on guidance.\" Kapai says students start their chain of tuitions after school time. When they reach home they are so tired that after dinner they go off to sleep leaving no time with parents.Stephenson adds, \"Once we asked a student to get a report signed by his father. The student said his father arrives after his bed time and is still sleeping when the student leaves for school.\" This disconnect is worrying. \"During parent-teachers meeting we tell parents no matter how many counsellors we have, no one would know the child better than parents,\" she adds.Schools like Modern & Centre Point have full time psychiatrists. Students can come to them and speak about their problems. Deshpande of Modern says, \"Students talk about more than just studies now. With media exposure their relationship with peers has also changed. They need to be guided properly as in the end everything will have an effect on studies.\"Urvashi Yashroy, director, Tuli Public School, asks her students to email their problems and issues directly to her. According to her, the mails are about issues that put students under undue pressure. \"I like taking the time to guide them. These emails are confidential and I write back to all of them. We also have a part time psychiatrist who comes to interact with students,\" she says.Regardless of what anyone says, students seem to be at the receiving end. Not wanting their names to be revealed, students of various schools told TOI that parental pressure was high. They always feel that parents compare them with neighbours, cousins etc. Chowdhury says \"I ask parents, have you always topped your class that you want your children to top all the time?\"',\n",

Teachers were seen gossiping on the campus or waiting eagerly for students' arrival. Both teaching and non-teaching employees of the college questioned the rationale behind opening institutions on the New Year's Day. The old concept to keep colleges closed during Christmas holidays extending up to New Year was just to rejuvenate students and prepare them for more rigorous classroom teaching, said a senior teacher of the college.At College of Commerce there were not too many students to attend classes. Even girl students kept themselves off college campus on the day. More or less similar condition prevailed at A N College, T P S College, J D Women's College and B S College, Danapur.According to B S College, Danapur, principal Praveen Kumar, the college virtually wore a deserted look on the New Year. However, teachers were present in the college in full strength, he said.At J N Lall College, Khagaul, students did not turn up leaving the teachers with no option than to while away their time on the college campus, said a senior teacher of the college, adding several teachers who had gone outside to spend the New Year with family members and relatives, were forced to come back and join their duty on Saturday.Meanwhile, release of list of new holidays at universities and colleges in the state drew a flak from university and college teachers due to curtailment in the number of holidays.

The government has permitted the import of 5 lakh extra long staple bales from other countries which makes it 380 lakh bales.\"Our requirement is 240 lakh bales and the permitted export limit is up to 65 lakh bales which makes the total of 305 lakh bales. Even then 75 lakh bales are lying with the farmers,\" he said.As a matter of policy, 50 lakh bales are being carried forward every year to meet any unforeseen eventualities and consequently 25 lakh bales will remain with the farmers this year, he explained.This year, the farmers are keen to sow cotton more than they sowed the previous year and if the rain is adequate, there will again be bumper crop in the coming season and this will create excess inflow and the price will fall alarmingly in the local market.Hirani said, \"There are crores of farmers as compared to hundreds of industrialists.

If the corporation removes the encroachments, the rest of the space can also be used as bus terminus, said sources.Sources, however, also fear traffic chaos on the road from Mehadia square to Panchsheel square when the operator starts using the ground.Mahesh Kandalkar, manager Vansh Nimay, said, \"We will be spending Rs 2 crore on creating this facility.\" Morone, however, expressed concern over slow progress of the parking space and poor maintenance of the buses.To streamline the city bus service, NMPL will also appoint a retired MSRTC official as transport manager and two automobile or mechanical engineers.

Economists feel that given the fiscal situation, the finance minister hardly has any leeway to go for a please-the-street kind of a budget either by giving substantial tax sops or any major cut in excise duty. Even if he were to do that, the long-term implications could be negative, they point out.However, market players are hopeful that the income tax exemption limit could be hiked by a few thousand rupees. They are also expecting the limit for tax exemptions on infrastructure bonds to be raised from the current level of Rs 20,000. The latter could help channelize additional funds into a sector which otherwise might find it difficult to raise more funds since several banks are nearing their sectoral caps, dealers pointed out.Looking back on the market trend on budget-day, of the last 10 budgets presented by four finance ministers, on six occasions the sensex had closed lower. So, the probability of the sensex rising on Monday is low. However, if one looks at the Budget Day sensex performance since Manmohan Singh's first budget on July 24, 1991, on 12 occasions the sensex had ended higher. Going by this, one can expect a positive closing for the index on the last day of February.The biggest single-session gain for the sensex on Budget Day was in 1992, Singh's second budget, when the index closed 9.4% higher. But market veterans pointed out that was also the time when Harshad Mehta was ruling Dalal Street. The biggest losing session was in 2009, when Mukherjee presented his first budget under the UPA II regime with the sensex closing 5.8% lower.Since Mukherjee's last budget, investors have become richer by about Rs 4.7 lakh crore with BSE's market capitalization now at Rs 62.9 lakh crore while the sensex has gained 7.7% to its Friday close at 17,701.Real estate stocks have taken a hammering, with several frontline stocks at or near their mid-2008 lows. On the other hand, consumer durables and banking stocks have gained the most, one of the main reasons being the fruits of the liberalization process, initiated by Singh two decades ago, driving up consumption in the country. On the flip side, as pointed out recently by RBI deputy governor Subir Gokarn, the prices of protein-rich food items have risen much more than basic necessities, fueling food price inflation.On Monday, the first two hours of trading on the Street is expected to be muted.

These funds scored due to their lower lock-in (three years) period, returns potential and efficiency.But ever since the proposal to exclude ELSS-under which one can claim deductions under Section 80C of the IT Act and which allows investments of up to Rs 1 lakh-was made, investors have become apprehensive. \"If ELSS is not a part of 80C (exemptions), nobody would invest (in the category) and it would die a natural death,\" says Suresh Sadagopan, certified financial planner, Ladder7 Financial Advisories.If ELSS products go out of the exemption list, they would be merged with diversified equity MFs, say observers. \"There would be no place for ELSS as fund houses would not have any incentive to keep separate fund managers,\" says Meenakshi.Investors then would have no choice but to invest in conventional options, including bank FDs, PPF and the national pension scheme (NPS). While the tier-1 account of NPS invests about 50% of its corpus in equity, it is allowed to take exposure only in index-related instruments and the investments cannot be redeemed before retirement. Infrastructure bonds come with longer lock-in periods and would be able to provide only single-digit returns.The assets under management of 49 open and close-end ELSS funds stands at Rs 24,571 crore in January.This is about 3.5% of the overall industry AUM and nearly 15% of the assets managed by all equity funds. ELSS products were introduced nearly two decades ago and initially there was a cap on investments allowed under this category, which was withdrawn around seven years ago.',\n",

But, CD Rai, the lone witness apart from Gupta's widow who did not turn hostile, is on the run for past one-and-a-half years fearing for his life. Rai, also an executive engineer in the PWD, was allegedly pressurised not to testify against Gupta's killer but he refused. He was suspended on charges of anomalies in 2009. Since then, he is untraceable. He did not even come to defend himself and retired on January 31 this year while remaining in suspension.Rai was posted in Auraiya before Gupta. He was transferred to Mathura after Gupta took charge. He knew about the criminal activities of BSP MLA Shekhar Tiwari and his aides. Sources said Tiwari's aides contacted Rai a day before Gupta was killed. They asked Rai to make Gupta understand the dangers of refusing to pay the extortion money to the MLA. Rai, sources said, told Tiwari's aides that why don't they get Gupta transfer out of Auraiya. Sources added that there was also a plan to implicate Gupta in a false sexual assault case in connivance with the Dibiyapur police station officer Hoshiyar Singh, who was also awarded life term by the trial court on Friday along with Tiwari. However, on the night of December 23, 2008, a heavily drunk Tiwari along with his aides went to teach a `lesson' to Gupta. Next morning, Gupta was found murdered. Rai while speaking in a meeting of engineers association on December 25 told his colleagues about the conversation he had with MLA's aides. His statement was highlighted by the media which mounted pressure on the Maya government, leading to the arrest of MLA and his aides.Later, Rai was pressurised by the senior officers not to testify against Tiwari but he refused. He was also threatened about suspension on charges of anomalies and implication in criminal cases. However, Rai refused saying that his conscience does not allow him to go back on his word. After Lok Sabha elections in May 2009, Rai was transferred to Etawah. He wrote to the state government to revoke the transfer as Etawah, a stronghold of the accused MLA, was unsafe for him. When his request was overlooked, Rai approached the high court and got relief. He was then posted in Agra. However, in December 2009, he was suspended on charges of buying certain equipment worth Rs 10,000 required for road construction without informing the higher authorities. He was not even paid the sustenance allowance and is not getting pensionary benefits after retirement, AA Farooqi, president UP Engineers Association (UPEA), said. Rai had in writing informed senior officials in the government and the UPEA about threat to his life and that he was threatened by the then PWD head Tribhuwan Ram of getting him implicated on charges of corruption.Ram, when contacted, said there is no mala fide in Rai's suspension. Complaints against Rai were lodged before Gupta's murder. The audit reports found anomalies in constriction work. I only forwarded the matter to the higher ups, he said. When told that Rai had even written against him, Ram said its human psychology to speak against a person who recommends action. Ram retired from PWD department on January 31, 2009, but was given two years extension by the state government. After completion of the period he is continuing as officer on special duty on contract basis with full administrative and financial powers required to manage PWD. He is also said to have been given ticket for contesting assembly election from Ajgara assembly constituency in Varanasi. However, Ram vehemently denied about getting BSP ticket and said that as a disciplined officer he is bound by the rules and cannot take part in any political activity. He added that UPEA is being controlled by politically motivated people who have launched a malicious campaign against him.

Primarily, it had cited level-playing field issues between existing and new entrants as the reason for opposing auctions.In May 2010, the Trai reiterated its opposition to auction of 2G spectrum by repeating the same level-playing field argument. It had then said, \"The authority concludes that it is not feasible to auction spectrum in the 800, 900 and 1800 MHz band.\"In its latest report released on Wednesday however, the Trai admits that 2G spectrum can be auctioned. Abandoning, without giving any reasons, its earlier level playing field arguments, it now states, \"It should be possible for the government to auction the surplus spectrum and treat this auction price as the relevant price of spectrum beyond 6.2 MHz for the given LSA (local service area), provided the auction is conducted within 12 months of the decision by the government\".However, the catch to 2G spectrum auctions in 2011 is that there is no spectrum left to auction. Trai\\'s data shows current pan-India spectrum availability at a mere 162 MHz; not a single new operator can be introduced in 11 of the 22 circles including 9 circles which have no spectrum at all. (See chart). According to Trai, auctions can only be held if 74 licences are cancelled, which could bring between 147 to 277 MHz of additional spectrum back into the kitty. Trai fails to explain why spectrum owned by government could not be auctioned in 2008 but can be in the future once returned by the same companies which acquired them without auctions. The Trai had written to the DoT recommending these 74 licence cancellations in November/December 2010 on grounds of failure to meet rollout obligations.The PM is likely to welcome the Trai\\'s support for auctions, as it is consistent with his own advice to former telecom minister A Raja in his letter of 2 November 2007. Trai\\'s new position that spectrum returned by cancelled licensees should be auctioned, is also strikingly in sync with telecom minister Sibal\\'s announcement. Given the pace at which legal formalities get completed - it could easily be over a year before telecom licenses are cancelled and spectrum reacquired by the government for holding auctions. By then, Trai\\'s recommendations for auctions could become infructuous.',\n",

       " '58f8439a7be9e078c98bca0b': 'While human rights activists across the world express their shock and outrage at Binayak Sen\\'s life imprisonment sentence, one of the biggest blows will be felt by his alma mater, Christian Medical College (CMC) Vellore. Until the verdict, the gentle doctor was busy, among other things, with a new project which could usher in a new light for healthcare education in India. Following the Social Determinants of Health report of 2008 by the World Health Organisation (WHO), Sen was appointed by CMC Vellore as a consultant to draft a curriculum model that would incorporate human rights within the ambit of healthcare and thus pave the way for a more socially equitable society.Ignoring his exemplary work among the tribals of Chhattisgarh, the Indian State imprisoned Sen in 2007 on charges of having links with the Maoists. In 2008, while still in jail, he was announced winner of the Jonathan Mann Award for Global Health and Human Rights. After several campaigns as well as appeals by 22 Nobel laureates, he was released on bail by the Supreme Court in May 2009. But the relief was short-lived: on December 24, Raipur district and sessions court judge B P Varma sentenced him to life imprisonment for the same \\'crime\\'. In such a scenario, CMC\\'s desire to implement the curriculum  which would have been the first to reinstate the Utopian notion that doctors are next to God  stands crippled.How did the seed for such a curriculum come to be planted? \"The WHO report has made a remarkable statement that social inequity is killing people on a grand scale. CMC has been in the process of incorporating the idea of social inequity into the curriculum. Except for some specific work done by organisations like CEHAT, JNU Centre for Social Medicine, Sama and the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, there is no precedent in India in unifying health and social inequity,\" Dr Sen told this reporter a few days before the verdict. His placid tone as always belied the burning passion that has seen him devote 30 years of his life to caring for the underprivileged.\"There is widespread hunger in the country today and the increasing levels of displacement and dispossession are further robbing the poor of their meagre means of livelihood,\" continued Sen. \"The situation is nothing short of a genocide, particularly since we have allowed this to happen for such a long period of time. The country is hungry for a Right to Health.\"The new project in Vellore did keep the activist doctor busy and away from his family for days on end. While still at the draft stage, the curriculum has already managed to get students to survey malnutrition in the hinterland. But it is Sen\\'s clinic in Dhamtari village in the now-famous district of Dantewada in Chhattisgarh that has faced a lull in functioning. The brewing violence between the armed forces and the Maoists  in which the tribals have been trapped and victimised  has stalled every kind of work undertaken by activists. Sen had been trying to get back the clinic  which includes a pathology laboratory, a pharmacy and a training centre for health workers  to its previous form. \"I haven\\'t been able to attend to the clinic on a weekly basis because of my extensive travel as well as the fact that the area has been declared as extremely sensitive,\" he said. \"It is tough indeed because no doctor is willing to go there. It will take time to reinstate the confidence of volunteers.\" But patience is a virtue that one could best learn from the man who was arrested on charges of being a Maoist after he blew the whistle on the state\\'s atrocities against tribals by the vigilante militia Salwa Judum.While the sessions court verdict may have angered scores of human rights activists in the country, Sen has always believed that the truth will eventually triumph. As a doctor  a healer and nurturer  his only concern most recently has been the issue of hunger. \"It is tragic that when 40 per cent of our countrymen go hungry, the government is gearing itself for military confrontation,\" he said. \"The government asserts that it has been unable to undertake any developmental projects in central India because of the presence of the Maoists. But what about those areas where there are no Maoists? We are in the middle of a crisis, and this cannot be solved with military intervention. If such measures are not stalled now, we are moving towards human annihilation. I feel inadequate that I haven\\'t been able to do much.\"Those who\\'ve been instrumental in foiling the doctor\\'s exemplary work would perhaps be happy to hear his momentary words of failure.Before his imprisonment, Binayak Sen was working on a unique medical curriculum model for his alma mater to incorporate human rights in the realm of healthcare\"The WHO report has stated that social inequity is killing people on a large scale. Christian Medical College Vellore has been in the process of incorporating the idea of social inequity into the curriculum. This is the first time this is happening in India\"',\n",

       " '58f843aa7be9e078c98bca1a': 'NEW DELHI: It was not the New Year gift that Delhiites were looking forward to. On the first day of the New Year, those going for vegetable shopping had a rude shock as prices of food items, especially onion, again went up. While in most parts of the city, prices hovered around Rs 60-70 per kg, in some colonies onion was selling for as high as Rs 80/kg.Said Subhash Mittal, who had to shell out Rs 80 per kg for onion at the Govindpuri market, \"This is ridiculous...prices that had gone down last week are rising again.\"The reason for the upward swing on vegetable prices is supply crunch, say wholesale market experts. \"The supply of onions is coming from Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh now, which is farther away than Rajasthan, which is the regular supplier of onions to Delhi. As a result, prices have gone up,\" said a trader. However, the wholesale market price  Rs 42 per kg on Saturday  was substantially lower than retail prices. Sources say the government, which had put in extensive effort till some weeks ago to bring down prices of essential vegetables, has now discontinued its efforts. The effect is apparent: prices which had gone down last week are rising again.Most retail markets are selling onion at random prices, much beyond the wholesale rates. The rates range from Rs 60 per kg in markets like GK II and Panchsheel to as much as Rs 80 per kg in larger markets like Govindpuri. Consumers say the rampant escalation is having an inevitable impact on household budgets. Said Aarti Mehra, a housewife, \"We can\\'t prepare any budget estimates now... prices keep going up and down, depending on the whims of shopkeepers.\"Those who keep watch on wholesale markets, however, claim there are several reasons for the fluctuating prices. Said Brahm Yadav, chairman, Delhi Agricultural Board, \"Rain ruined some of the onion crop while the on-going agitation by Gujjars and other reasons have had an impact as well. The biggest reason is that supply is short in the Delhi wholesale market. While the usual demand is between 1,000-900 tonnes, for the past few weeks we\\'ve been getting only 400-500 tonnes supply of onion.\"',\n",
       " '58f843ab7be9e078c98bca1b': 'PANAJI: The state government has relented and hiked its funding for the Carnival celebrations in the state, bowing to pressure from the various town organizing committees.The file for the hike in funds was cleared at 7pm on Friday evening, sources said. Members of the Carnival organizing committees who met tourism secretary D C Sahoo on Saturday were informed about the change in decision.According to the revised funding, Panjim Carnival Committee gets .Rs30 lakh, while the Carnival committees of the cities of Margao, Vasco, Mapusa and Ponda get.Rs15 lakh each. With the money issue settled, the Carnival parades will roll out in the state\\'s towns from March 5 onwards.The state government had slashed funding of the Carnival festivities in the state last month.On January 20, the government had decided to give \\'Panjim Carnival Committee\\' Rs 4 lakh, while Margao, Vasco and Mapusa and Ponda were sanctioned Rs 3 lakh each. The government told the committees they would have to seek sponsorships if they wanted to increase their funds.This had led the Panjim Carnival Committee 2011, headed by Joaquim Teles, to write to tourism director Swapnil Naik on Friday, seeking details about the funds sanctioned to the committee to plan the arrangements as well as programmes for Carnival 2011.The letter stated: \"A meeting of the office bearers of the Panjim Carnival Committee 2011 was held on February 22, 2011, after the cancellation of another meeting convened by the department of tourism on the same day. In the cancelled meeting, the department of tourism was supposed to indicate the budget/funds allotted to Panaji and to other centres around Goa where Carnival parades are held. Till today, we are not aware of how much funds are allotted to Panaji, and in the absence of this figure, it is not possible to plan the arrangements, activities and programmes for organizing the Carnival, which is only eight days away.\"Last year Panjim Carnival Committee had received Rs 35 lakh, while Margao, Vasco and Mapusa had been sanctioned Rs 15 lakh each.',\n",
